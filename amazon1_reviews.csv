214,"Bad Design, Substandard Keyboard, dont buy this or any of its variant model laptops!!!","My Lenovo Ideapad 3 laptop is still in warranty and since Dec 2020 has had two keyboard replacements. One or more keys stop working within an year. After the first replacement during manufacturers warranty, I decided to extend my warranty for another year and that has saved me from a big expense.<br><br>The worst part is the keyboard is not a replaceable component on its own. The keyboard is part of an assembly that includes the touchpad, speakers and the top frame on which one rests one hand while typing, see pics for details. Besides the design of the hand rest where there is a drop in the hand rest where the trackpad ends and the keyboard begins is faulty, this drop touches and rubs against the screen when the laptop is shut and screen is folded down as one would normally carry or store the laptop.<br><br>without extended warranty this laptop is unaffordable as Lenovo will replace the whole assembly comprising of speakers &amp; trackpad if the keyboard malfunctions, which has now happened twice with me, each time a new one was replaced.<br><br>If one has to replace a faulty keyboard at ones own cost, one will be billed for the replacement speakers as well as the trackpad which may be perfectly ok as was in my case, not once but twice.<br><br>I cannot even begin to understand why this is so, it must have come through in QA and testing, if any was done at all. This is unacceptable, never again will I buy any Lenovo laptops again, this is my first and last Lenovo laptop.<br><br>Have had DELL, Toshiba, Asus and HP laptops in the past, none was as worthless and troublesome as this one.

It will charge quickly...<br>not recommended this one for gaming may be u will feel lag.<br>Screen visibility and display quality is good because it provides anti-glare display. so, u didn't get any reflection while using.<br>Trackpad is little bit hard to operate.<br>Keyboard is good and it provides backlit while use on night times.<br>It will come with ms office and alexa inbuilt<br>Build quality is quite good not better.<br>Overall its worth to buy at this price range<br>Thank you Amazon and Lenovo.",4.0 out of 5 stars

340,Good laptop.,"I don't know why people are cribbing so much about the screen. The laptops which have an IPS display with a similar configuration (and 15.6"" screens) are mostly over Rs. 55000. You get what you pay for. The screen and display are absolutely fine otherwise (yes, you can watch movies and everything else). Also, this is one of the only few models in this price range which has a backlit keyboard. If an IPS display truly matters though, you do have some Lenovo, Acer and HP laptops which are &lt;45000. I'm not sure if they have backlit keyboards though. The only issue I have (and this applies to all other brands) is the fact that almost all the newer laptop models have really small Up and Down arrow keys which is very inconvenient if you use them a lot. My fingers are getting cramped up due to that. It takes a bit of time to get used to them. If you want standard sized arrow keys, get another model. The laptop works smoothly otherwise and is good for everyday use. Also, there's no point complaining that games work slowly because this is NOT a gaming laptop. The onboard graphics on this is roughly as powerful as a GeForce GTX 765m SLI, a GPU that was released in 2013. If you're playing games from that era, you can play them at 1080p at high settings. Don't expect today's games to run well. After cashback, I got this laptop for Rs. 43,690.5 .",4.0 out of 5 stars

542,Harrowing experience,"&nbsp;Disclaimers:<br>1. My review is based on the rough 3 weeks for which I used it. Post that, I returned the product.<br>2. This review is not to be construed to mean that all products in this line are necessarily bad. It could be the case that only I had a bad experience.<br><br>I will state the cons first as they far outweigh the pros.<br>Cons:<br>A. The primary and probably the biggest con for me (which resulted in me returning the product )  was that the display would flicker at intervals (From Day 1 of using the product). Sometimes the flickering wouldn't persist for long  and would occur only for a few seconds. At other times, it would just go on and on, making work impossible and having to re-install the display driver to make it stop. I'd be using it mostly for work (Microsoft office and Adobe) and otherwise, to watch videos and movies. At an average, I'd have to reset (uninstall and reinstall) the Display Driver once every day. Never got around to gaming with it owing to the display flickering problem, as it  used to get quite irritating. (Refer to my video to understand the problem of flickering)<br><br>B. The speaker quality is very average.  The highest volume doesn't produce sound audible enough. So for music, movies etc. , you'd have to use speakers or earphones/headphones.<br><br>C. Acer support  is not upto the mark. After raising my complaint with them and despite the fact that it was a brand new product , they did little to assuage my concerns. They refused to send anyone to pick up my product and said I'd have to get in touch with one of their service centres and personally go there to deliver it. Neither did they give any assurance on a timeline within which they would be able to resolve my problem, nor did they offer a temporary laptop to use while this one got fixed (this was a real problem as I need a functional  laptop at any given point in time and I had also explained my situation to them).<br><br>D. The charger input slot is such that you have to insert the charger at a certain angle; otherwise it's difficult to insert. And to get that angle right is quite difficult. I would keep it plugged in and operate it by switching on and off the main switch (like a Desktop PC).<br><br>E. Battery life is not too good. I wasn't even doing any heavy work or gaming and the battery would last for hardly 4-4.5 hours before reaching 20% from full charge.<br><br>Pros:<br>A. Amazon support was pretty good as compared to dismal Acer support. They arranged for a technician to come and  inspect the problem I had complained of. Amazon does not have a return and refund policy for electronic items and only a replacement policy in case of defective goods. Thereafter , after the technican uploaded his report, I was assured that I would get a replacement of the defective product with a brand new product. However, as it turned out, the seller had exhausted his stock of the product with no idea on when he'd be able to procure new stock. So all in all, I stood to get a full refund after a return was arranged. Just returned the product and am awaiting my refund to reflect in my account.<br><br>B. The fans are placed stategically such that it does not heat up while working. This is particularly good for heavy gaming.<br><br>C. The display resolution is pretty good (my flickering issue aside).<br><br>D. Machine performance is really fast.<br><br>E. Looks stylish.<br><br>To conclude, my advice would be to purchase from an authorised store (whatever laptop you're purchasing, irrespective of the make) after physical verification. It's better that way.  Prices may be cheaper online, but you get quality assurance through physical purchase.",2.0 out of 5 stars

So They replaced the SSD and the issue was resolved in one week. Then after two days of usage, the laptop failed again, and again started giving an error of ""No Bootable Device"". Then again I called up support and this time they changed the MOTHERBOAD. Then after one day of usage the charger stopped working.  So again I called up the support and told them this product is complete failure and please give me a replacement. This has been going for one month now. And my work has severely affected. Now when I mailed the support for the replacement of the product because it's just a train of failures in this product, they replied me that I'm on my own and they only can give me services and not a replacement and clearly this is a defected product.

600,Probably the best budget gaming laptop in India currently.,"I felt that the Acer Nitro 5 2019 model would lack in a lot of important spheres, mostly pertaining to music production (I use FL Studio very often with plugins which take a huge toll on the CPU), as well as gaming. But, I have not been disappointed at all.<br><br>PROS:<br>A) The CPU is amazing. As I write this review, I am aware of the fact that the Acer Nitro 5 2020 edition has been released with a stronger i5 10th generation processor, but for the people who think the 9th generation CPU lacks anywhere, you're clearly mistaken. The 10th generation is better, but there are no seismic differences between the 2 generations. No problems with any of the plugins in FL Studio and the CPU handles most recent titles, such as Death Stranding exceptionally well.<br>B) GTX 1650 is easily the best budget gaming GPU that you can get. Of course, the GTX 1650ti is also a formidable opponent, but I am having absolutely no issues with the GPU. The frames per second (FPS) I am getting on games like Death Stranding, Rainbow Six Siege, Watch Dogs 2, Grand Theft Auto V, Tekken 7, etc. is more than enough.<br>C) The 8GB RAM is good, although you should definitely go for another 8GB stick. The more, the merrier :)<br>D) Many people have talked about screen bleeding issues. I personally don't have that problem. Although 60Hz on a panel of this laptop's caliber seems awkward, I don't have anything else to complain about when it comes to the display. The hertz can be overclocked to around 90Hz or so.<br>E) Keyboard feels good and responsive.<br>F) Battery backup is respectable.<br><br>CONS:<br>A) Don't even want to talk about the speakers.<br><br>Overall, for casual gaming, this laptop is amazing. I am having tons of fun with it, and for someone who upgraded from a stupid Geforce 920M GPU and an i3 4th generation CPU, this fulfills my need perfectly.<br>To quote a joke well known in the gaming community: 10/10, IGN!",5.0 out of 5 stars
601,"""Best Budget Gaming Laptop""","Writing review after almost using for 3 months.<br>Boot up is very quick.<br>It has many other features like NitroSense, Acer Network Optimiser and Acer Quick Access.<br>So these are value addition to the product.<br>Looks premium in design.<br>But not a metal body though as in case of Nitro 7 which is costlier.But it's absolutely fine.<br>Camera is average or enough and that's the case with all the laptops.So as such you can't complain about camera.<br>You get 930 GB of HDD and around 236 GB of SSD.But since Windows is installed on SSD so you get around 200 GB only.<br>Played games like GTA V, PUBG in ultra graphics settings and also installed softwares like Adobe After Effects, Photoshop and Media Encoder.All work perfectly and no significant lags experienced.<br>Everything is working perfectly.<br>Also the brightness level of the keyboard light can be adjusted with 4 different brightness levels.<br>So this is one more feature.<br>The dual cooling is also very effective.<br>The speakers are also great.<br>They are too good for a gaming laptop, a lot more than what I expected.<br>No issues with display as well.<br>You get a 1080 p screen which is normal.<br>Also what I liked a lot are the very THIN BEZELS.<br>So due to this, the screen looks a lot better.<br>So overall no issues experienced till now.<br>Everything is working perfectly.<br>Only SSD can be added as it has one vacant SSD slot.<br>Will mostly add another 16 GB RAM and a half TB SSD, if not a TB to run it flawlessly for future.<br>Hope you find the review helpful !!😊😊",5.0 out of 5 stars
602,Performance is good obviously because it is new now let's see,"Received the laptop the next day itself after ordering. The packaging was not good, just a big box with the laptop box inside it. No visible damage though. The box contains a laptop and charger with some cool stickers along with a user manual (who reads that these days, lol) and a warranty card.<br><br>After using it for almost 2 years... It has stopped working... Not able to find what the issue is. Doesn't charge, doesn't power up. Stopped working suddenly in between gameplay due to overheating and won't work. I was using a cooling pad and power supply etc was fine. Sad to see such poor quality products.<br><br>After 3 days of testing, benchmarking and heavy usage:<br><br>Pros:<br>1. Game performance is good (GPU reaches 150 fps on extreme graphics)<br>2. Battery Backup good (around 4 hrs on normal usage)<br>3. Video editing and rendering is fast enough<br>4. Display quality is great<br>5. Dual fans with manual speed control<br><br>Cons:<br>1. Keyboard is not much responsive (misses some keystrokes when typing fast, not recommended for coders, very frustrating)<br>2. I have encountered complete freezing twice when browsing the internet in the last 3 days, but no freezing when gaming (yet)<br>3. The keyboard again, very frustrating when it misses keystrokes and i have to go back and correct it again.<br>4. WebCam is ok ok quality, did not like it very much.<br>5. The position of the touchpad to the left side and not the center is annoying (cant rest my wrists comfortably)",5.0 out of 5 stars

604,Overall A Good Product,"I bought this on July 1st, 2020. Adding this review after one year of use.<br><br>Battery Backup: Overall good laptop with good battery backup. if using a remote desktop I get  8 hours backup. For normal use like chrome, music, movies I get approx 6 hours of backup.<br><br>Editing: up to 2k resolution video in the premiere pro is really smooth for editing. photoshop/Lightroom no issues with speed. But the screen color is not much good, it's an okay kind of thing. (In this price range it's really good)<br><br>Gaming: I am not a hardcore gamer, I played Forza Horizon 4 and GTA 5. I don't get any lagging issues.  Always plug in a charger and play.<br><br>Hardware: Overall good quality no issues till now. I like the keyboard it's nice, the trackpad is smooth compared with hp pavilion<br><br>Speaker: It's Okay not very good.<br><br>Screen: Good for watching movies and gaming, I won't suggest you if you are a professional video/photo editor.",5.0 out of 5 stars
605,Awesome!,"After a month of usage, all I have to say is this: this laptop is the budget king!<br><br>For this price, a powerful Core i5 processor, reasonably powerful GTX 1650 graphics card, 8 GB RAM (although I'd recommend an upgrade to 12/16 GB), fast PCIe SSD, massive 7200 RPM HDD; what could go wrong? It's the best for its price!<br><br>99% of games can run on this laptop will minimal issues and awesome graphics. The fans are quiet on idol mode and get a bit loud on heavy use. Everything is fast, responsive and amazing!<br><br>The battery life is on the poor side. On normal use (like web surfing), I got around 4 hours which means that you'll have to carry the bulky adapter around which would add some weight to the somewhat heavy laptop. While gaming, you can expect a solid hour but I'd rather plug-in and play. Most of the gaming potential is lost when on battery so just plug 'n play!<br><br>The screen is fine. My unit's backlight bleed is not much of a bother although I would prefer a slight increase in brightness. I'm not much of a video editor so I don't know much about the colour accuracy. It's fine to say the least.<br><br>The keyboard is good. Trackpad is good. The speakers aren't the best.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this to any budget gamer!",5.0 out of 5 stars
606,Awesome Mid Range Gaming Laptop,Review after 7 days of usage<br>Pros-<br>1. Intel I5 Processor does most of everyday work without any lag or performance issues<br>2. NVIDIA GTX 1650 provides 60+ fps for Need for speed games and around 55-60 fps for witcher 3 at high settings<br>3. Trackpad and keyboard feel good<br>4.Windows loaded on SSD makes it super fast with around 5-7 sec boot load time<br>5. Audio from speakers ok as long as u dont keep it flat on bed and instead on a raised surface.<br>6. Battery Backup around 4:30 to 5:30 hrs for normal day to day internet browsing provided brightness kept at 50%. But battery charges up fast in 1:30-1:45 hrs<br><br>CONS:<br>1. Audio could have been better because currently speakers placed in downward direction<br>2. Display brightness could be a little better<br>3. Very slight Screen bleed from left top side<br><br>While Gaming CPU temps reaches 91-95C  which cause thermal throttling. This can be avoided by undervolting the CPU.After Undervolting CPU temp stays around 79-85C which is a great dip.<br>8GB Ram bit on low side for graphic intensive games .Would recommend an upgrade to 16 GB Ram .<br><br>But Cons don't matter much because Pros are too awesome.<br>Would recommend anyone to buy this laptop.,5.0 out of 5 stars
607,Fantastic product but expensive at this price,"I bought this as my second laptop to work from home since my earlier lappie was not fast enough. I would say that this is a fantastic purchase. It takes less than 10sec to boot due to SSD and a powerful processor. I might replace HDD with a capable SSD later on. The battery lasts ~7-8 hrs for office work and have not checked it for gaming yet. The price is at least 10-15% higher than usual due to prevailing shortage of laptops in the market.  This could be due to anti China feeling as well. I realised this would continue till the festival season so went ahead and bought it. One should wait for price correction if not in any urgency. After one week of usage I would say that its screen, backlit keyboard and track pad are great.<br><br>One big con is that it is slightly higher weight so not very handy to carry in comparison to my previous lappie.  Screen could have been sharper and missing touchscreen at this price. At this price level they should have provided MS Office student version or antivirus for one year which only lasts for one month.",5.0 out of 5 stars

609,Subtly dressed young brother of predator series at a well thought price👌,"Brilliant Machine.<br>I would suggest upgrading the RAM to 16 GB and get a good cooler for avoiding thermal throttling during graphic intensive games like Far Cry 5 at high/ultra high. I personally use 2 fan cooler from ZinQ technologies.<br><br>The problem with mainstream gaming laptops like ROG Strix is that they are not easy to live with. They are built for gaming and gaming only. You sacrifice on the webcam and fan noise is unbearable at times. MSi lacks the after sales satisfaction which mainstream companies can provide. Lenovo Y540 is a great package but it comes at a premium price which to be honest, many of us can't afford. ACER Nitro 5 hits the sweet spot. Pricing is well thought. Quality is good enough and if your don't move around frequently, it will last you a long long time.<br><br>If you can afford this machine, don't think twice.<br>If you don't want to compromise on the performance, don't think twice.<br>If you want to pamper yourself with casual gaming, you are choosing the right products.<br><br>Feel free to drop questions if any.",5.0 out of 5 stars

635,Good with some minor setbacks.,"To sum it up, It's a bang for buck at 60k, which is the price I got it at. I've been using the device for about 2 months now, so here are the Pros and Cons<br>Pros<br>1. Decent Battery Backup For a Gaming Laptop , I get around 5hrs for normal use however for continuous video playback I get around 3.5 hrs. Didn't test for gaming on battery though as I prefer gaming while plugged in for peak performance.<br>2. Ergonomics are good. Has a slim profile and is well built, doesn't feel cheap at all and is sturdy. Weight balance is also good.<br>3. Port selection is good and conveniently located.<br>4. Gaming performance is as expected , can play AAA titles on high/ultra at decent FPS. Keyboard is decent enough.<br>5. Thermal Management is decent as well and has option for manual control of Fans through Nitrosense.<br>6. Charging Speed is quite good, charges from 0-100 in around 1hr 40mins<br> Now for the Cons<br>1. Slight screen bleeding but can be adjusted by applying little force on screen. Not noticeable in well lit environment or on low brightness.<br>2. The headphone Jack is tricky, it doesn't work when inserted normally, you have to insert the pin quick, like fast. Maybe issue with my piece but it's bearable.<br>Rest assured, it's a good buy.",4.0 out of 5 stars
636,Overall performance,"As for the camera, well you cannot expect a Laptop camera to be like your phone camera and click selfies with it! It's a decent enough camera!<br><br>Battery, as for minimum usage (MS Office, MS Teams, Zoom, etc), it could easily stretch around 4-5 hrs, and if you enable the battery saver mode (which is quite effective indeed), then even longer! And while gaming, you may sit with your laptop near the socket, all plugged in and ready, in brief, of course gaming drains the battery faster, so keep your charger plugged in at that time.<br><br>Now when it comes to gaming, it can handle high end games easily.<br><br>Speakers are okay. You can adjust your speaker preset through the Nitrosense app (for which you have the “N” key beside the Number Lock key), and that way you can choose a louder preset!<br><br>Build Quality isn't really the best, but hey, it's not bad either!<br><br>Overall, it's not at all a bad choice; but if you are able to, then do choose a gaming laptop which costs from 70k - 80k, or one which isn't LCD to not experience any backlight bleeding",4.0 out of 5 stars
637,Overall Good product. Honest review,"I am writing this review after 21 days of buying. Display is good, but there is screen bleeding issue, my laptop has so much screen bleeding but after laptop start it's bleeding not seen. Battery for normal use is 4-5 hours, I have not played yet game, but when I'll play I'll again write review for that. Booting is very fast (3 sec).<br>Backlit is also usefull. Audio is Good. some people says that audio is very less, but it's not, audio is good. Webcam is not so good and not so bad it's just meadium, but it doesn't matter so much.it doesn't heat for normal use,I don't know for gaming, but I'll absolutely tell after I play games on that. Fans are very good for cooling. No problem about processor it's really good. Graphics Card is also good. Look is also very good.",4.0 out of 5 stars
638,Good for its range,It's a good laptop for those with graphics and designing needs with a low budget.<br>For gamers I wouldn't recommend as the graphic card is way behind its 3000 series cousins. I would suggest a custom desktop built if you want gaming + heavy duty work as it generates a lot of heat if not properly managed may damage the system,4.0 out of 5 stars
639,4 star. Good product. Read the review.,"Really smooth. Boots up before you know it.<br>Am having my MBA classes online coz of Covid, and this device is great at handling multitasking, like multi tab operations, multiple apps, video meets with research on the side.<br>Speakers are better than average, although expected more loudness and clarity.<br>Hasnt heated up even once in the past one week...and the fans haven't been used to even half their potential yet.<br>Am not a gamer.<br>Battery lasts for upto 5 hours while multitasking. And 6-6.30 hours while single tasking.<br>Got it for 60k. Found it to be worth it.<br><br>Also, i didnt give it 5 stars since no product is perfect XD.",4.0 out of 5 stars
640,Amazing!!!,"An amazing product to buy at such a prize.<br>Everything is up to the mark.. Build quality,  screen, performance, gaming experience. Battery life could have been better, the product description says it to be 11hrs but for normal use it will last around 4 hrs &amp; on gaming around 1-1.5 hrs.<br><br>Also I initially received a corrupted OS , my system was not booted up after first restart, but acer covers it in the warranty &amp; install a new OS although I have to take it to the service centre, so a little disappointed by that.",4.0 out of 5 stars
641,Worth the price,"works amazingly, clear screen, good battery life without gaming comes for about 4.5 hrs. needs to be plugged for gaming for better gaming experience, keyboard needs some getting used to (difficult to type takes time), charge slot at the side makes an awkward position , runs NFS payback at highest graphics that's enough for me ;)<br>speakers average, lots of noise gets added vibrations, the maxaudio app barely reduces it but need to use as better alternative than very low volume without this app.",4.0 out of 5 stars
642,"A very good laptop for gaming, video editing and normal work","Pros- good display, ok processor,good graphics card, good IO, good looking and a ok battery life<br>Cons- won't charge with USB type c, mediocre webcam and mediocre keyboard and mousepad<br><br>fps in games- gta 5 60 to 90 fps high settings, red dead redemption 2- 45 fps balanced settings, Forza horizon 5- 60 fps medium settings,<br>video editing- smooth<br>office work- good (you should buy a cheaper laptop if you just do office work)",4.0 out of 5 stars

780,It has the worst screen,"&nbsp;Laptop is good interms of speed because of SSD and 8Gb ram. All applications runs smooth without Lag<br>Its lightweight very light and comfortable to hold and the design is good<br><br>But for me the worst part is display. Its not even HD screen for 28k cost and the worst is its TN panel, because of TN panel i get worst viewing angle.  Even if i sit right in front and tilt the screen i see white glare in on screen. The TN panel plus the non HD screen makes a good combination for giving you a worst display. If u work on such display for long you will get headaches.<br><br>I think Lenovo giving so cheap display in 28k product is not done.",2.0 out of 5 stars

808,"Good laptop, questionable longevity","At features and price, this is a good laptop. The screen quality is decent and the setup is convenient. This is running Celeron, so obviously there's no gaming for this machine. It's unfortunate, but that three month game pass is pretty much useless. MS Office setup is easy and straightforward.<br><br>There are a few negatives. First, the wire going from the laptop to the screen is very visible at the hinge. This is a potential point of failure and I think it will affect the life of the laptop.<br><br>Another annoying aspect is the continuous upselling attempts by Lenovo. The laptop includes Lenovo Vantage software, which could be necessary for some aspects like firmware updates. However, Lenovo keeps pushing users to buy additional software coverage, including by throwing popups on the screen while you work.<br><br>Some annoying issues, but I think it's overall a good laptop.",5.0 out of 5 stars

925,Good device if you know how to use it,"DECENTLY FAST LAPTOP ONCE YOU SET IT UP!<br>First: Once you start it after unboxing and set up the windows, it will perform slow for a bit. Don't worry. Go into settings, windows update, and download all updates &amp; restart to install the downloaded updates. This will take some time. Be patient.<br>Second: When all windows updates are installed and the OS is upto date, for the time being, uninstall bloatwares like Prime video, Instagram, WhatsApp, xbox etc. Clean it up as much as possible by removing unnecessary apps. Set up McAfee Live Safe by opening it up from app tray.<br>Third: Most importantly, this machine comes with Windows S mode i.e. you can only download apps from MS Store. If you want a decently fast machine, stay in the S mode. Forget Chrome, use Edge browser built in. Its based on chromium only. If you want to slow the machine down, Google how to get out of S mode.<br><br>Conclusion: For the price (similar to a chromebook) it is a good laptop for browsing on Edge browser, YouTube, Netflix, Prime video, MS office, MS Teams, Zoom etc. All this can be done in S mode smoothly.<br><br>Update: At this price point, the keyboard is of really good quality. Typing experience is good. Amongst the chromebooks and Travelmate and other laptops at this price &amp; size, I think this was a good choice for me.

1018,A great laptop if you know how ...,"Do you know how many laptops have dual drive? Hardly any. Most of the high end i5s and Rizens come with a single M.2 interface and you are stuck with the factory given SSD of measly 256 GB or 512 GB space. Now you'll say I can buy a larger capacity SSD. OK, what's the cost of a 2 TB NVME? At least 16K and what happens to the older nvme stick?. This is why I always buy laptops with dual drives and this laptop has it. You can have<br>- One nvme m.2 drive<br>- One regular SATA3 interface HDD or SSD<br><br>With the above option, you can have a 512 GB SSD (3.5K INR for Crucial) with 1 TB HDD allowing you to store all your songs, movies etc. and YET have the FULL speed of an SSD based system.<br><br>Though I did not purchase this laptop at Amazon, I bought it from a local store for 1K higher price, after initial start I noticed how SLOW everything was. In fact even my laptop 15 years older is a lot faster. In any case I never intended to use the default HDD but I was curious to know HOW slow it could be after reading everyone's reviews - YES it is SUPER SLOW.<br><br>Then I stuffed in a P1 500GB NVME SSD and re-installed Windows 11 and the performance was mind-blowing - actually not really mind blowing because I have been using high perf laptops for quite some time - the minimum RAM any of my laptops have is 20 GB minimum. Now this laptop comes with 8 GB of RAM, but I found Windows 11 to be quite responsive and snappy for all basic work like YouTube, browsing, Discord, listening to music and the likes. I can always replace the 4 GB RAM stick with a 16 GB RAM stick to have a total RAM of 20 GB which is pretty good.<br><br>In case anyone wants to know how to re-install Windows 11 on an SSD read on..<br>1. Start your new laptop, register Windows 11 etc. Ensure you note down the Microsoft account that you use to register. Also search the Internet on how to print your Windows 11 CD Key, this is a command run in the command prompt, you can write down the CD key or mail the CD key to yourself.<br>2. Search for ""download windows 11 media creation tool"" and go to the Microsoft site which comes up in the search hits<br>3. Select the second option of ""Create Windows 11 Installation Media"". This will download a tool which you need to run.<br>4. You will need to have a USB Pen Drive of at least 8 GB capacity.<br>5. When you run the downloaded program, it will ask you to confirm if the Windows Installer should be created on the attach USB Pen drive, confirm this.<br>6. Depending on your internet connection speed this process will complete in 10-15 minutes.<br>7. You now need to go to the ""Settings App"" -&gt; Select ""Recovery"" -&gt; Select ""Advanced Startup"" . OR keep the SHIFT button down when clicking the ""RESTART"" button.<br>8. The computer will reboot but instead of going directly into Windows, select to boot from attached device. Now Windows Installer will load from the USB drive and you can install Windows 11 completely fresh. Note: during installation you should select 'Advanced' and select to install Windows on the new HDD (SSD). The installation usually completes in 15 minutes, YES, SSD makes it THAT fast. I would advise against deleting the existing Windows 11 partitions that are present in the original HDD (just in case). You can always format the HDD after Windows 11 has been successfully installed on the new SSD.<br>9. You'll have to again enter details like the PC name etc. Ensure you use the SAME Microsoft account to register your copy of Windows 11, it will auto-activate. In case registration fails, you can always use the CD KEY you printed in the first step to activate Windows 11.<br>10. Once Windows 11 is fully installed using the laptop will be a totally different experience.<br><br>Anyway, those of you who already purchased this laptop, you made a great choice, if you want the same performance as other laptops, I strongly advise you to do a fresh install of Windows 11 or even Windows 10, this ensure NO additional software is installed which vendors always install for marketing, data collection purposed, all these useless software only make your computer slow.<br><br>-- all the best --",5.0 out of 5 stars

I think is probably because of Coronavirus and lockdown.<br>The display is average and the color reproduction is very bad. The viewing angles are terrible, only person can watch it properly that too it gets faded out from top and bottom. Not at all ideal to watch a movie, series or let alone a youtube video for 2 or more people.<br>I had an issue while using the keyboard, it is backlit but certainly not one of those best ones that I've used.<br>Purchase this laptop if you are a student needing a fancy laptop with high end configuration for the price you are paying.

1068,Except speakers ..everything else is captivating..,"Design<br><br>Asus has done a solid job of carrying over some of the premium design touches of its higher-end ZenBook line. While picking up the VivoBook 15 gives away the plastic construction both due to feel and the plain black plastic bottom, the illusion is intact when it is sitting on a desk. The textured finish paired with the silver metallic sheen of the Asus logo centered on the lid makes for a nice contrast.<br><br>Lifting the lid reveals the ErgoLift Hinge, which angles the keyboard deck slightly upward for a superior typing experience. The interior of the laptop carries over the same finish as the lid, including a color-matched trackpad with a built-in fingerprint sensor while the keyboard breaks from this with a standard black finish. The area around the keyboard also gets a subtle texture change with tiny indentations and it is slightly recessed, presumably to avoid contact with the display when closed. The NanoEdge Display lives up to its name with minimal bezels on each side, but it would be nice if that included the top bezel as well.<br><br>At 3.7 pounds, 14.1 x 9.2 x 0.8-inches, the VivoBook 15 isn’t going to be challenging premium thin and light laptops, but it compares favorably to other 15-inch laptops in this price range. It comes in just a hair lighter than our top choice for best laptops under, the Acer Aspire 5 (3.8 pounds, 14.3 x 9.9 x 0.7-inches), and it's even lighter than the HP 15 Laptop (4.4 pounds, 14.8 x 9.7 x 0.9-inches). Thanks to its thinner and narrower dimensions, it will fit in a slightly more compact laptop bag as well.<br><br>Ports<br><br>If you haven’t converted to an all USB Type-C life, then the bounty of ports on the VivoBook 15 is going to be a welcome sight as this laptop offers a solid array of options.<br><br>The left side of the laptop is somewhat sparse with just two traditional USB Type-A ports, both USB 2.0, but things get a lot more interesting on the other side.<br><br>The right side of the Asus VivoBook 15  features a power jack, another USB Type-A port (USB 3.1), an HDMI 2.0 port, a USB Type-C port, a combo headphone/mic jack and finally a microSD card slot.<br><br>While I would swap out one of the USB Type-A ports for a second USB Type-C port, overall this is an excellent setup. If you do happen to need an additional port, an RJ45 Ethernet port or a full-size SD card reader, for example, you can take a look at our best USB Type-C hubs page and take advantage of that powerful port.<br><br>Asus VivoBook 15 display<br>The VivoBook 15's 15.6-inch, 1920 x 1080 display produces sharp images, but I found the colors were washed out and the panel overall was quite dim.<br><br>Watching some movies, the VivoBook 15 couldn’t reproduce the vivid red of the titular character’s costume and left the rich and varied environments feeling drab and listless. The screen also suffers from a somewhat aggressive sweet spot when it comes to your viewing position; if you get just a bit off-center in any direction, the image falls off quickly.<br><br>Brightness is a serious weakness of the Asus VivoBook 15, which is capable of only 205 nits in our testing. That compares poorly to the Acer Aspire 5 (258 nits) and even the HP 15 Laptop (222 nits), which were also below the category average of 268 nits.<br><br>Keyboard and touchpad<br><br>I averaged 80 words per minute on the 10fastfingers.com typing test with the VivoBook 15, which is slower than my current average of 86 wpm. I was surprised that the 1.4 millimeter key travel wasn’t more comfortable. Instead I found the keys were mushy and lacked a strong bounce that helps move your fingers from key to key.<br><br>The key spacing is excellent for the most part, I just wish there was a slightly greater separation between the standard keyboard and the numpad, but its presence is great for those who need to enter figures regularly. I was pleasantly surprised by the backlighting on the keyboard, it delivered even lighting on the keys and made for an easy low-light typing experience.<br><br>Audio<br>The dual bottom-firing speakers on the VivoBook 15 manage to stay clear throughout their range, but simply aren’t capable of high volume and can’t produce any meaningful bass.<br><br>I listened to some music and even at full volume, the VivoBook 15 couldn’t fill my small living room to a satisfying degree. The vocals were acceptable, but lack some of the punch that you would get with a more premium set of speakers or good headphones. The atmospheric music simply doesn’t come through even when I sat directly in front of the laptop.<br><br>Performance<br>The Ryzen 5 3500U processor paired with 8GB of RAM does sound impressive, the laptop loaded up two dozen Google Chrome tabs, including two YouTube videos running at 1080p and a pair of Twitch streams without a stutter as I jumped between all of them. Obviously, you aren’t picking up the VivoBook 15 for gaming, but when it comes to simultaneously handling an array of web tasks and apps, you shouldn’t have any issues.<br><br>In Handbrake video transcoding test, which requires the laptop to convert a 4K video to 1080p resolution, was a not difficult for the VivoBook 15. The laptop finished with a time of 15 minutes and 30 seconds.<br><br>The VivoBook 15’s 512GB SSD isn’t doing it any favors taking  29 seconds to duplicate 4.97GB of mixed-media. This is good for a transfer rate of 177 megabytes per second.<br><br>The VivoBook 15 managed only 8 frames per second on Sid Meier’s Civilization VI: Gathering Storm, well shy of our 30-fps playability threshold.<br><br> Battery life<br><br>Depending on your use case, the battery life result for the VivoBook 15 might be the nail in its coffin as it lasted only 5 hours and 20 minutes during our test, which involves continuous Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness.<br><br>Camera<br><br>It’s hardly alone in this problem, but the Asus VivoBook 15 is an excellent reminder to pick up an external webcam, particularly considering the frequent use of video conferencing and video chat apps these days.<br><br>A glimpse at the live image on the display might fool you depending on the lighting, but take a selfie with the 720p camera even in bright light and you’ll immediately see an abundance of noise and a complete lack of detail.<br><br>Heat<br><br>The exhaust vent that runs the length of the VivoBook 15’s back edge coupled with the trio of vents on the bottom of the laptop were enough to help it breeze through our heat test without a problem.<br><br>The test involves playing a 15-minute, 1080p video and then taking temperature readings on various parts of the laptop. On the VivoBook 15, the touchpad remained at a cool 72 degrees Fahrenheit while the underside got a little toastier at 91 degrees, but even its hottest spot, next to the rear vent, never went above our 95-degree comfort threshold.<br><br>software and warranty<br><br>Asus doesn’t overload you with proprietary software or even much bloatware. There is no Candy Crush in sight, for example, but it does offer you an AudioWizard app to try to squeeze more performance out of the speakers and the useful MyAsus app that provides you with information regarding your warranty and service options along with the serial number and access to some system utilities.<br><br>You can use the MyAsus app to tweak your hardware settings for the display, battery, and other such features. It also includes a tab that will offer deals on some apps, like the Adobe Suite. It will also walk you through the process of installing and connecting the link to MyAsus app for your smartphone, which allows you to control your iOS or Android smartphone to varying degrees.<br><br>The VivoBook 15 comes with a one-year limited warranty. You can see how Asus fares in general on this front in our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands special reports.<br><br>Bottom line<br>The Asus VivoBook 15 is an excellent looking laptop. The display looks great in terms of a minimal bezel experience, but that only lasts until you power it on because the screen is dim and dull.<br><br>There are aspects of the keyboard experience that are good, the ErgoLift hinge does a nice job of angling the keyboard slightly and the spacing and key travel are quite nice, but it’s undercut by the sponginess of the keys.<br><br>And while the size and weight of the VivoBook 15 would make it a relatively nice option for those that need to haul their laptop around, the pretty abysmal battery life makes it tough to recommend for that purpose.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Display could have been better. or may be Im too harsh comparing it to the MacBook that I already have. I think I should have gone with the 14inch rather than 15inch as the keyboard on 15inch takes some getting used to. The other thing that bothers me is that the laptop cannot be opened with one hand. All the MacBooks that I have can be open with a single hand, even the MacBook air and it definitely makes a difference.<br>I bought this at 43.6k incl GST so at 37k excl GST its a great buy as you get a much lighter laptop with Reyzen 5 processor, 8 GB RAM and 512 GB SSD Drive which makes the laptop lightning fast.<br>the 2 degree ergo lift feature is also quite useful.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Response of TS and FS teams are very prompt but there is a worst customer care department. It took them almost 15 days to pick up the old laptop, which was lying duly packed by their representative. There is no contact No and chat box to reach CC team while you can get easily get through TS and FS and they are very responsive too. So, be careful not to land up with the CC team of Lenovo for any reason. Having not received any response from CC team, I searched Google and got an escalation e-mail id. After sending a complaint to this e-mail id and they writing a mail to CC team, marking copy to me only, I got response from CC team.

1339,Excellent Value for Money Laptop.,"This is one good looking laptop. It's light, sufficiently powerful to run office and some light apps with email (i use it as a travel machine, so that is all i need to do with it. If i need to do other coding related work i use it to RDP into my work desktop). I recommended this to four other people two of which are students and use it heavily for taking notes, attending classes etc., and i have not heard them complain once. Excellent battery life.<br><br>One issue with the newer models is that they don't charge over USB c. My nephew has a older model of the same laptop which charges over USB c. Maybe this is some cost cutting gimick Lenovo has started pulling. Also my laptop shows no indication that it is charging when it is powered off. For my newphews machine, the led is on when it charges. There is also slight light bleed on my lcd from right right edge when the screen is pitch black but for all other laptops this problem doesnt exist. None of these are major issues but please be aware that Lenovo is pulling cost cutting gimicks in the new model.<br><br>Overall I would highly recommend this because if you are looking for a small laptop or two in one which is light and portable, there is literally nothing else in market that you can buy in this price range.<br><br>Some people use iPad or Android tablets for on the go work but I just could not do it. Bad software support on both (stripped down version of office, no support for wine on Android) and clunkly folio cases with bad keyboard and no mouse pad make tablets a really bad decission for anything other than content consumption and note taking with a stylus. You should only buy a tablet if those are your use cases. This machine though is the best of both worlds. With 7 to 8 hours of battery life it can pretty much couple up as a tablet.<br><br>There was a time when this machine used to come with free active stylus. Now, it doesn't. I don't even know if it supports stylus any more, since Lenovo seems to have gone completely silent about it in documentation.<br><br>All told if you are looking for a probable laptop to do some light but real work using Microsoft office, obsedian, notion etc. and have budget of twenty K this is what you want to buy. If you are a student with typical student use cases and don't want to play demanding games, again buy this machine. If you want to buy laptops for elders in the house, buy this laptop. Hope this clarifies and helps people make a decission depending on their use case.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1340,PERFECT BASIC TOUCHSCREEN LAPTOP IN 20K RANGE,"I'm going to leave an HONEST REVIEW, I read others, and some people commented about flaws of multitasking, speed being slow etc. etc. I haven't purchased a LENOVO laptop ever in my life, THIS IS MY VERY FIRST LENOVO PURCHASE, so this review is completely UNBIASED....so let me run a detailed review at a price point of about 20k and small ram and storage, I bought this simply for basic purposes (youtube, writing, social media, emails etc.)<br><br>Screen: BEAUTIFUL, runs 1080p wonderfully, produces a good picture AND IS TOUCHSCREEN WITH DETACHABLE FEATURE MAKING IT A TABLET!<br><br>MultiTasking: I currently have whatsapp running, 8 tabs open in chrome (1 which is facebook, 2 are youtube, 1 is insta etc. and I have edge open) IT IS RUNNING SMOOTHLY. It is a mini powerhouse and is running beautifully<br><br>Detachable keyboard: works like a charm and has nice keys, the screen pops in like a puzzle/lego peice<br><br>Another beautiful benefit is there's no huge laptop kind of fan / outlet! LESS NOISE! LESS HEAT!<br><br>Battery lasts very long 8 hours give or take depending on what you're using it for (videos and streaming naturally will use more battery)<br><br>Speakers: On the Standard Size, but it is Tablet like, so that is to be expected, sounds like a standard tablet/mobile phone but audio quality is quite crisp and enhanced, but you won't get surround sound deep bass effect.<br><br>It is not meant for gaming, so don't give it aa bad review if it can't run your favorite games, it is a budget laptop that is extremely mobile, extremely portable 2 in 1 type, perfect for web browsing, video watching, email checking, word processing etc. I gave it 5 stars because it met all my requirements and the screen is absolutely beautiful!

1583,Good laptop.,"I don't know why people are cribbing so much about the screen. The laptops which have an IPS display with a similar configuration (and 15.6"" screens) are mostly over Rs. 55000. You get what you pay for. The screen and display are absolutely fine otherwise (yes, you can watch movies and everything else). Also, this is one of the only few models in this price range which has a backlit keyboard. If an IPS display truly matters though, you do have some Lenovo, Acer and HP laptops which are &lt;45000. I'm not sure if they have backlit keyboards though. The only issue I have (and this applies to all other brands) is the fact that almost all the newer laptop models have really small Up and Down arrow keys which is very inconvenient if you use them a lot. My fingers are getting cramped up due to that. It takes a bit of time to get used to them. If you want standard sized arrow keys, get another model. The laptop works smoothly otherwise and is good for everyday use. Also, there's no point complaining that games work slowly because this is NOT a gaming laptop. The onboard graphics on this is roughly as powerful as a GeForce GTX 765m SLI, a GPU that was released in 2013. If you're playing games from that era, you can play them at 1080p at high settings. Don't expect today's games to run well. After cashback, I got this laptop for Rs. 43,690.5 .",4.0 out of 5 stars

Battery backup is good. Please check each and  every thing within 7 day's as you can get replacement or return within that period bcoz it's better  than replacing parts in new laptops.

1866,Beware!!! A Good Budget Laptop but...,"&nbsp;Purchased this laptop at 25k, and using been using this for the last 10 months. Here is my brief review of the Laptop's performance.<br>Design: In the budget segment, most laptop has an average plastic build, but this one is different. Build Quality is awesome for the price. Even after using it for 10 months, there is no deterioration. Laptop lid is still pretty much solid- no wobbling or looseness.<br>Display: This laptop comes with a 15.6” HD display. Yes...it's an HD display which means it's not 1920x1080, the maximum resolution we can set is upto 1366x768. In this price segment we can easily find full HD laptops…so yes if you are into FHD display..you aren’t getting it in this laptop. Brightness is good for indoor usage.<br>Keyboard: This laptop comes with Chiclet style full standard size keyboard. These chiclet keycaps are small and need time to get used to them. Overall ok..ok…no problem till now.<br>Performance: As this is an entry-level laptop, it comes with an Intel Celeron processor which is built for a basic-light task only. I bought this laptop for office usage.. on which I am mostly using MS Office, Tally, and Chrome. With this kind of usage, we can even multitask. No issue at all, But if you are expecting some decent performance out of this laptop for, Gaming and animation tasks.. then this laptop can’t do that. Talking about the Entertainment, yes we can even enjoy 4K movies watching (watch the attached video for 4K Test), and as the in-built speakers are actually better than my expectation, you can watch movies with friends and family.<br><br>Now let me quickly share some Pros &amp; Cons:<br><br>PROS<br>1. Superb Build Quality<br>2. Looks premium in budget<br>3. Great Price-performance ratio<br>4. Lightweight (1.6kg)<br>5. Smooth 4k video playback<br>6. 2-3 hours battery backup<br>7. Fingerprint sensor<br><br>CONS<br>1. HD Screen (1366x768)<br>2. No LAN port<br>3. Poor Webcam (watch attached video)<br>4. Nonsense Upgrade options<br><br>I will update the review if find anything worth sharing.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1969,Superb powerful laptop,Great laptop… i dont know whether it is good for gaming… but the performance is fantastic. No lag at all,5.0 out of 5 stars
1970,Fantastic ultrabook around 63K INR budget.,"I bought this a few days ago, and I am glad I decided to make this purchase. This laptop is probably the only laptop in its segment that boasts such a spec heavy configuration without breaking the bank. The HP pavilion is such a compelling buy and boy does it deliver a premium experience throughout.<br>Having used a Pavilion 15 before, I gravitated towards the Pavilion series predominantly because of the typing experience and the speakers tuned by Bang and Olufsen! They sound mighty impressive for the price! It’s the same experience this time around. The audio is loud and crisp, and typing experience with 2 stage backlit chiclet keys is fantastic! They key travel and feedback is great. This probably is nitpicking, but the only gripe I have is the Power key is placed next to the Delete key. Although, accidentally pressing the power key won't turn off the device or put it to sleep. The 250 Nits IPS panel is crisp and bright for day to day indoor use. The viewing angles are great too with HDR playback support. Although, I would have loved atleast 300 nits plus panel given the price of the device. The chassis seems rigid and built to last! The top cover and the keyboard deck is metal, stays cool to touch as compared to the bottom cover which is plastic. The trackpad is quite large and supports windows gestures. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate. The laptop remained silent during my entire sessions of document editing and reviewing. However, the fan kicked in during a windows update, and it was loud. The 43Wh cell helps this laptop with a good battery life. The 65-watt barrel pin charger helps in charging the device quickly, and the device can also be charged via PD enabled chargers via the Type-C port. One nifty addition is the HP Quickdrop. It lets users to transfer files back and forth with a companion mobile app. It’s a great addition for me as I can edit photos on Lightroom and quickly share them to my phone to be shared on social media! The i5 11 gen is a beast of a processor and it barely breaks a sweat during photo editing sessions. It can do some light title gaming with the Intel Iris Xe graphics.<br><br>Some closing thoughts:<br>The HP Pavilion with 16Gb RAM and 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 can be ideal machine for folks wanting a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty sticker price. It is like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY without compromising on processing power. It has been a fantastic purchase so far!",5.0 out of 5 stars
1971,Very happy with the laptop,"Did a lot of research and landed on this laptop. I am not a gamer and didn't want a gaming laptop or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. If that's your thing, then probably look elsewhere. Was not able to find this configuration anywhere for this price - 512gb SSD, 16gb RAM with i5 processor. It's an absolute beast. Everything flies and windows is looking so much better now (I was coming from a macbook pro). I was taken a back at how good this thing is. Does all the daily tasks without a sweat. The audio output is also decent (not great). Has a USB C port which can be used for charging (haven't tried this, but someone else had put a detailed review with this feature - check it out).<br><br>One con: If you close the lid and connect it to an external monitor, the wifi speed drops, if you're a bit far from your router. Let me explain: my office room is a bit far away from the router (don't ask me why I set it up like this). I took the laptop there and connected it to my monitor and closed the lid and kept it on a stand. The wifi became very slow. I disconnected the monitor and opened the lid and checked to see that the wifi speed was triple now. Googled and saw that the wifi antennas are below the trackpad - so someone suggested to keep the trackpad part of the laptop on top while placing it on the stand. This helped a bit; in the end, I kept the lid a wee bit open on the stand, and this solved the issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1972,One Of the Ideal Laptop for professional or student use.,"I have been using this laptop since August, it's very compact and lightweight. The weight distribution is good but you still cannot open the lid with one hand.<br><br>The screen is okay not the best I have seen but you can perform day to day task very easily.<br><br>Keyboard is quite good, the key travel is nice and the three-level backlight is awesome.<br><br>The battery is same as any slim professional laptop, gives 4-5 hrs battery backup in normal use and definitely this number reduces when heavy tasks are performed.<br><br>Fingerprint accuracy 8.5/10.<br><br>Upgradability is the single ssd that you can swap for more storage and from two- 8gb ram one them is upgradable.<br><br>Conclusion, this laptop is a very good performer in the basic to semi-heavy tasks. Due to lack of dedicated graphics card, games are not as smooth they should be but as a professional this device in one of the best.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1987,Value for money,"Writing this review after 15 days of usage. The box contains the laptop and the charging cable. The laptop weighs  exactly 1.4 KG, and it's quite nice. It has all the specifications as advertised, i.e. 16 GB ram, and 500 GB NVME SSD. It does not have IR camera so no face unlocking will support. The finger print sensor is fast. Office 2019 is pre-installed and needs only to be activated, so while booting up for the first time it's best to have a mail id ready. the USB type C port is good and I have tested with data transfer only, not display and power output, although according to blogs and forums it will support both. Battery life is not completely tested but it's fairly ok, as of now I have got backup worth of definitely 6 hrs.",5.0 out of 5 stars

2015,"At this budget, it’s surely a go-to-device! Powerful!","Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).<br><br>Clarifications/issue points:<br><br>1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.<br>2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.<br>3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.<br>4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.<br>5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)<br>6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.<br>7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.<br>8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>1. Configuration is best at this price level.<br>2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.<br>3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.<br>4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.<br>5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.<br>6. Display is average and gets the job done.<br>7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.<br>8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.<br>9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.<br><br>Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.<br><br>I’ll update this review after one month of usage.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Here's my review after 3 days.<br><br>Build &amp; Looks are awesome. Very thin &amp; sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light &amp; noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.<br><br>Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) &amp; same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram &amp; 512 NvMe SSD.<br><br>Features: Comes with ""Office Home &amp; Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available.

It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full &amp; med bright).<br><br>Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.<br><br>Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures &amp; Videos are grainy.

Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it.

Lasts for about 6-6.5 hours with normal use.<br>3)Lacks voice assistant, but honestly it’s not a deal breaker<br>4)Soldered Ram<br><br>Verdict: Overall Good device with certain cons. Folks looking to buy this for entertainment might be discouraged by the speaker, but the screen is gorgeous. I mainly bought this for work and it perfectly serves my purpose. I would have given it 3.5/5, However, I bought this early and got the Galaxy buds 2 for 999. I would say this makes up for the terrible speakers :P<br><br>Hence my final rating is 4/5<br><br>P.S MS Office was not activated. However, Samsung service personnel and Microsoft technicians helped me out with this and solved the problem. As promised, this does come with Ms Office.<br><br>P.P.S First, fully update your Laptop. Then, contact Microsoft support and share with them the receipt. In my case, first, they uninstalled MS Office 365, then they installed MS Office home &amp; student 2021. Then they did some of their magic and it was activated. All this happened via screen share and it took around 1.5 hours.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I got this for 72k which is quite a winning deal. (mrp 96k minus samsung launch discount 16k minus 4k credit card discount minus 4k samsung ref discount)<br><br>Cons-<br>1. The worst thing about this laptop is the dolby speakers. Its of no use. If u heavily need laptop speakers then this is not for u. I use earphones most of the time hence i can ignore this. But so far, this is the worst laptop speaker ever.<br>2. They claim of HD 720p camera. I found it quite mediocre. I expected it to be crisp but its very noisy camera.<br>3. Touchpad looks and functions well but the clicks are not smooth or silent  . You need to press it and hear the click which i found really pathetic.<br>4. The battery back up is 5 hrs max for light use like attending video lectures, study purpose etc. For heavy application is might be 3 hrs. Dont go by Samsung's claim for 8 hrs. I never got it .. even in the beginning.<br><br>Overall this laptop works good for my use of studying, video editing (adobe premier pro) and little gaming .

2265,"Bought 20K worth of company promotion, not a smartphone!","I just made a huge mistake today(25th June 2022) buying this phone after looking at spec sheet and Youtube reviews alone. Looks like the company has deceived many people including consumers and reviewers by sending a wrong expectations.<br><br>Yes, I knew the camera was not going to be excellent as it should for a mobile positioned at 20K INR. But look at the first picture, 12Megapixel of rear camera after advertising 50MP AI Camera? BTW, front camera shows the resolution as 16MP<br><br>The front camera feels bit ok than the rear. It is so weird!<br><br>And from the start, till setting up the phone, it is full of bloatwares and unauthorized advertisements popping up in apps' interface like Phone Master, all over UI, sucking up 64% of 8GB RAM for no reason at idle!<br><br>Look at the pictures I have shared for RAM and the number of apps currently installed.<br><br>The phone otherwise feels snappier for just swiping through screens but I haven't done any heavy usage like gaming to say.<br><br>I can't even imagine having such a poor software optimization, a company dares to market a phone at 20K INR!<br><br>So cheap attitude!",1.0 out of 5 stars

I feel cheated. Please don't mislead the people. It is really 6nm chip has been put inside it. I doubt that. When I refund, they are saying to visit the technician after two days. They should tell the customer before buying that they cannot make the refund directly. now I have to wait for two days for the technician in which there is no my fault. This is not a transparent deal with amazon. They just give 7 days for the refund. when they could not give one minute extra from the time of refund policy, why are they taking two days in that period?  But anyway, thank you for wasting my money.",1.0 out of 5 stars

2276,A gaming beast!,"Alright here’s the thing! Looking to buy a phone for it’s camera? Look elsewhere. Don’t even bother buying this one.<br><br>For anything else, this phone’s a BEAST!<br><br>A 3 week review:<br>It can rival any flagship on performance. Gaming is a dream! Most played games- New State on Max Ultra as highest graphics, Asphalt 9, Modern Combat 5, Crash Bandicoot, Iron Blade, NFS Most Wanted. Games are super smooth and it’s a killer performer! If you wanna get this phone  for gaming performance, the CPU GPU are sick. Mind it mild heating is experienced when playing New State on highest graphics, but nothing even close to being warm. 120 Hz refresh rate works fine. Haptics are satisfactory.<br><br>Day to day performance is a breeze. It crushes the S20 FE. Obviously due to a newer SOC. No stutters no lags, not a single app crash in 3 weeks is commendable. It runs on Android 11 and no update yet. Though it’s running on security update released in September. I don’t have hopes on that front. It runs on a heavily skinned version of android, which I personally don’t like at all, but its stock launcher is just fine. Though I don’t use it.<br><br>Screen is LCD, and outdoor visibility is poor since it doesn’t go up too much on brightness in nits. But the colours are just fine. Very nice display for indoors. Games and videos look immersive. The screen is a mammoth size and gripping the phone isn’t a task as it isn’t too heavy without the case. It does come with a case in the box so that’s awesome! I’m not a Man City fan, so the embossing of the logo on the phone’s back as well as on case does feel a bit forced upon, but it’s easy to get over after a while, especially since you’re not staring at the back all the while. You tend to forget it’s there.<br><br>It has a single bottom firing speaker which is not too loud. That’s one thing I don’t like. There’s no reason not to include a stereo setup especially when the cheaper Pova 3 has it.<br><br>The body is all plastic, but doesn’t feel cheap. The rainbow effect on back is just beautiful. Overall the looks are gorgeous I feel. The camera modules too blend in beautifully. The back makes any other phone look outdated frankly. It’s so futuristic. Hold it to believe me!<br><br>It’s got a very bright flash on rear and a front facing flash too. That’s awesome. But cameras…meh! I won’t even talk about it.<br><br>The battery easily lasts more than 24 hours with moderate gaming, YouTube playing and few phone calls. It’s a humongous battery! Charge speed is just ok. I’d have liked it to include a faster charger, but at this price, you really can’t complain.<br><br>So basically guys, it’s a gaming beast. Just go ahead and buy it without much thought if gaming is your thing.<br><br>And oh the bloatware! It’s annoying. They put Samsung to shame with the amount of bloat they have loaded. But most things you can get rid off. Other things you can simple disable. Although that’s additional work after buying the phone.<br><br>Scores out of 10:-<br>Camera - 2<br>Screen - 7<br>Speed and performance - 10<br>Software - 5<br>Price and  affordability - 20!",5.0 out of 5 stars
2277,Great Buy,"The box contains:<br>-The phone(with pre-applied screen guard)<br>-Charger<br>-Sim ejector tool<br>-Phone Case<br>-Warranty card and a manual<br><br>About the phone:<br>On the first day using the phone, it discharged very quickly. Also charging from 2 to 72 percent, it took around 3 hours. But these statistics were only for the first day.<br><br>From the second day onwards, the phone seemed to last as labelled on the app. It's been a full day and the phone only came down to 62 percent from 100 percent in the morning.<br><br>*Performance is excellent.<br>*Refresh rate lives up to the mark.<br>*Battery backup as stated is really good except for the first day.<br>*Camera is decent<br>*Although the phone comes with many pre-installed unwanted apps, majority of them can be removed without any hassle.<br>*Speaker is fine<br>*Voice quality is good while on phone<br>*The call recording feature alerts the other person about the call being recorded. I'd recommend to install third party call recorder.<br>*One of the best features I liked about the phone is Video Assistant. You can actually watch YouTube videos without keeping the screen on. It really helps when you use YouTube for listening to music. The video assistant can be accessed from the smart panel by dragging and holding your finger from either the right side or the left side.<br>*Have not tried playing games on It yet<br>*Fingerprint sensor is amazingly fast and accurate. Face unlock too.<br>*On an average, it takes around 1.5 hrs for full charge.<br><br>After 2 weeks of usage:<br><br>*Refresh rate sometimes drops below 120hz, you can feel it, and have to restart phone.<br>*Battery backup is amazing, around 1- 1.5 days of battery backup for normal usage.<br>*But charging is not upto the mark. It takes around 1.5 - 2 hrs to get full charge while the company states it takes 30 min for 50% charge which is unrealistic.<br>*Brightness is a little low as it is sometimes difficult to see in sunlight.<br>*Phone heats a little while playing games but that is common.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2278,Best budget phone for anyone!!,Great battery life. I used it for two days on a single charge. Very good clarity in the camera. But there are some problems in the phone like there are useless apps pre-installed and you can't even delete it!!! But still overall it's an 8.5 out of 10 for me.,5.0 out of 5 stars
2279,Value for Money smartphone but with a catch.,"If you could get this phone for 16k or lower then it is actually a value for money phone with decent processor and specifications.<br>Sure the phone would have been better if it had a better camera and an amoled screen but you cannot get everything for 16k I guess. They have to do cost cutting somewhere.<br><br>Pros :<br>1. Snappy for day to day usage and moderate gaming.<br>2. Excellent Battery life (8hrs Screen on time for heavy usage and 12hrs for low to moderate usage). Could last a day and a half in simple words.<br>3. Big display so a good media consumption experience. (AMOLED would have been better though).<br><br>Cons :<br>1. Speaker. Not loud and not so good quality.<br>2. User Interface, though has many things to offer, it is full of bloatwares and not so much optimized.<br>3. Camera is good for QR code scanning and average photos in daylight but forget about good pictures at night.<br><br>Last thing. Since all the mobiles generally come with google dialer now, this phone also has default google dialer and now the other person will get notified when you start recoring the call. :-)<br><br>Conclusion: If you are looking for a phone that could last for 2-3 years doing basic smartphone things like media consumption, moderate gaming and using social media and do not want to spend more than 15-17k on a smartphone then this might be the phone for you but you might need to compromise a little on clean UI and a good quality camera phone.<br><br>Lastly, the company is relatively not so famous and trusted like other big brands so after sale services and quality assurance are still the things to be tested for me as well.<br><br>Till then it is doing pretty good job for my use case scenario.",5.0 out of 5 stars

A screen guard is recommended (but not easy to get it for this model). Though it says it's 120hz refresh rate, scrolling is not as smooth as a your premium phones with the same refresh rate. Battery is awesome. Slight heating is noticed while charging but nothing to be too cobcerend about. Decent fingerprint scanner. No complaints wrt to Ram. Excessive bloatware(which can be uninstalled). Camera is ok although the photos look a little too perfect and clean. It sucks that Tecno has not confirmed an Android 12 update while it's contemporary Infinix zero has. I hope they do release it for this model. Although some people have complaind about the app lock, it seems to work fine. There is a secure Vault feature too. There are a bunch of free themes and wallpapers offered, which is great. THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION THAT THIS IS AN INDIAN PHONE BUT PLS NOTE THAT IT'S AN OUT AND OUT CHINESE BRAND..THE SAME COMPANY WHICH OWNS INFINIX BRAND. Claim is that its manufactured in India but its a Chinese owned brand. Overall it's a really decent buy at this price point.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2405,Cheap but clearly at the expense of performance,"You can keep this as a phone you might want to use as a backup in case your phone breaks down all of a sudden.  It might serve a purpose better than having no phone at all. To me, it seems like Redmi is openly saying that for a phone with a price of &lt;7k, a terribly unresponsive interface and graphics lag is what you can overlook, given that the ROM is 32gb while RAM stays still at the 2gb mark. Up to a certain extent, I could agree to this argument, but Redmi 6A, which is a model way older and was sold back in 2018-19 is a much better smartphone in terms of responsiveness. We are not buying a new phone - be it a cheap one - just to find that the call logs screen takes about 2 to 2.5 secs to transit from an older call log screen. And if in between this, you happen to press any of the dialled nos, it would make a call to the unintended contact before you realize that it was an older screen. This becomes frustrating after a while.<br><br>This phone has an outstanding battery backup with normal usage. That said, I think it is one buyable smartphone among those close to this price point.",3.0 out of 5 stars
2406,Good Budget Phone for Basic Usage,"For a 2Gb RAM 32Gb internal storage this phone works miraculously. Good for basic social media usage like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram but would not suggest for gaming purpose. Though overlapping of videos seems to be an issue but overall in 480p the videos run smoothly on any platform. Good budget phone for basic usage only.<br>Fingerprint Sensor : Missing<br>Battery Life : Low for strenuous usage<br>Camera Quality : Takes good shots",3.0 out of 5 stars

She still uses 2g sim and did not bother to test installing apps or updating phone. Post a month after delivery my brother visited home and tried helping mom with updating phone os and installing basic apps like whatsapp etc but  for he found that app download is not working and os update is also not working. Its been month and amazon 10 days return policy is expired. Have emailed beand not aure if I will get an response from them or not and how will this be treated.

2718,The process to purchase against exchange is troublesome and didn't work out.,"The policy of exchange of old phone, while purchasing a new one is not correct. The delivery person is asking for the old phone to be given to him while he is delivering the new one. The old phone contains all data and application which needs to be transferred to the new phone. And for that at least one day time is required. In my case, I was forced to make full payment as I failed to handover the old phone to the delivery agent. This is a wrong policy, in my opinion, and should be looked into carefully. Flipkart offers pickup of the old phone as per customer's convenience, which is good policy, and provides the value of the old phone after picking up and checking the condition of the phone. My request to amazon is to look into it carefully and change the policy accordingly.",2.0 out of 5 stars

2749,OK Phone,"Phone is good, but not excellent. I bought a low cost phone as i keep breaking phones. Although this says 4gb Ram, 64 GB storage, latest processor etc. This phone lacks lot of options that were available in the phone i had bought 3 years ago. Its probably good for people who dont use phone as their daily necessity to work, compute, record and depend. The battery is 5k MAH, but doesnt last more than a day. no short cuts available for screen shot, flash light, calculator, speed ram, clean up. There is no option for widgets too that i needed badly on my phones. Anyways, as said its a basic phone and the color and screen size is good.

3005,Genuine review after 4 Months of use.,"Reviewing after 4 Months of using the device.<br>If we talk about specifications, it's no doubt there is no smartphone available in the market in this price with this much high specs BUT it's of no use.<br><br>Even after having this much high specs on paper, the experience of using the phone doesn't make us feel that we are using that much high spec powered phone and the price is too high for the overall user experience. Reasons are coming down.<br><br>Starting with the good part and going further with the unpleasant experience of being a user of iQOO 7 legend.<br><br>Looks (9/10)<br>No one can deny the phone is having an eye catchy look and the company provides cover with the BMW Logo makes is more cool. The BMW M Sport inspired stripes on the back makes it look more premium.<br><br>Charging (9/10)<br>The phone is having 67 W fast charging which is actually superfast. The phone charges from 0 - 100% within 30 mins if on standby. If you charge it while using the same, the time takes to charge it fully is bit higher depending on the work you are doing.<br><br>Dual Speakers (7/10)<br>Company have provided the dual speakers but the sound is not that loud. It feels like a single speaker only.<br><br>Display (7/10)<br>Packed with AMOLED display with the 120Hz refresh rate. Looks good but not the best.<br><br>Camera (6/10)<br>Inspite of having 48 MP camera, the pictures quality is not so good. Not bad too but can be bettered.<br><br>Battery backup (6/10)<br>The phone is powered with 4000 mAh battery wich doesn't last till it should be. Battery drains too fast even on standby. A power bank is must for long travellings.<br><br>Gaming (6/10)<br>Despite of having SD888 processor, the high end gaming like PUBG/BGMI doesn't makes feel you that you are having a monster. Introducing the phone as a gaming phone is just a hype. The phone is having 120hz refresh rate still PUBG/BGMI still not supporting 90 fps. Game center is having a good options like picture in picture using WhatsApp. Voice changer (needs some improvement).<br><br>RAM Management (3/10)<br>I was using 12gb RAM variant of it. Having so called 3gb additional virtual RAM. Even having so much of RAM, the apps get refreshed if in background. Even if the screen is on and you are working on phone. Also there is no option of disabling the virtual RAM. This means you are having 3gb less internal storage and it is not actually adding any value to the experience of using the device.<br><br>Heating (3/10)<br>Heating of device while heavy usage like playing high graphics games or using some heavy application is understandable but this device even heats on standby while all the apps are closed and no background work is in process. So much dissappointing.<br><br>UI/OS (2/10)<br>The phone is having so called Stock Android based FuntouchOS. I have used Samsung, MI and OnePlus phones. The FuntouchOS is worst of all. So let's talk about why it's worst.<br>- If you are using 2 Sim cards and you wanna switch the data connection, there is no option of doing the same from notification shutter. This can be only done by going to the settings.<br>- If you like customization, this phone is for you only if you want to spend extra money even after spending 40k - 45k. Why extra money? You can't even change the icon of the phone without using different themes provided at the theme store. And yes for using the themes you need to buy them first. The price is not much but still after spending the hefty amount if you can't even change the icon by just using icon packs from the Play Store then it's irritating.<br>- It may shock you but it's true that the phone does not supports AR (Augmented Reality). May be this is not the deal breaker but but but, again if you are spending that much hefty amount of 40k - 45k and not getting the very basic feature wich is available in the lowest price phones then this is unexpected.<br>- Always on display only shows limited application notifications.<br><br>What can be bettered (this part is just for the understanding the capacity of device)<br>- Instead of FuntouchOS, if the company have worked on the global vision of the OriginOS (currently only available in devices launched in China) and would have launched the device with the OrginOS, the user experience must have been increased.<br>- Notification LED is missing but can be fixed. How? Whenever the front camera starts, LED light blinks around the camera. The same can be used as notification light.<br>- Data switch option in notification shutter can be given by just small update.<br>- Virtual RAM disabling option needs to be added.<br><br>My conclusion: the device look is really awesome and eyecatchy with the BMW branding but spending 40k - 45k just for the looks is not a good idea because other things of device does not worth the amount.",2.0 out of 5 stars
3006,IQOO 7 LEGEND 5G DONT WAST UR MONEY AND SPECIALY ON AMAZON THEY FOOLED YOU,"IQoo7 legend.<br>Pros:<br>1. Solid &amp; premium build<br>2. Latest SoC SD 888 waste for non gamers.<br>3. Great looks<br>4. Fast charging 0 to100% in just under 25 minutes.<br>5. Good rear camera in day light.<br>7. No heating issues on general use.<br><br>Cons:<br>1. Really heavy 206 gms, very difficult to handle in one hand.<br>2. Small battery for the weight, just 4000mah,<br>3. Very poor battery back up. Hardly lasts 8 to 10 hours with normal use.<br>4. Too much of bloatware, u can't uninstall or disable.<br>5. Funtouch 11is a poor UI<br>6. Absence of key features like file safe/private safe folder,<br>7. Highly complicated UI. Worst in the market.<br>8. In screen finger print scanner placed too low, n sluggish. Not user friendly.<br>9. Absence of 3.5mm jack<br>10. Poor quality back cover provided. Highly slippery.<br>After one weeks usage:<br>1. Worst phone. Never buy this crap.<br>All-new phone with SD888 hangs on day 7 and nothing u can operate barring volume button. Power button stuck to Emergency call n will not be able to re-start or power off.<br>Then no option but to force start.<br>2. Bad cameras in low light.<br>3. Due to weight very difficult to operate in one hand.<br>4. Very poor battery life.<br>5. I don't know what all information they collect. Every basic function asks for permission to gather personal information.<br>6. As a wellwisher my advice, please don't buy, if you have bought one return or replace it soon.<br>After 10days of usage:<br>1. Poor network connectivity<br>2. When you're on a call, an incoming call will light up d screen, n proximity sensor stops working, so either ur call is disconnected, or some unwanted action performed.<br>3. Very poor speaker volume n clarity<br>4. After few minutes into call, the call quality gradually drops, n need to struggle to hear.<br>5. Upper border of display has black tint needing aliasing SW n tweaking<br>6.  proximity sensors doesn't work, screen keeps lighting.<br>7. If you are using connected to say Bluetooth in car, once you get out of the car, or BT interrupted, call doesn't get transferred to phone speakers, trust me phone hangs.<br>8. With ongoing call, you can't switch to an incoming call, phone hangs.<br>9. This crap is with full of bugs.<br>So, friends, one of the worst products. Think 100 times before buying!!!<br>DONT BELEVE  ON  AMAZON  THEY ARE MAKING FOOL YOU  WHEN  YOU RETURN THE PRODUCT  IN MY CASE I RETURN THE DEFECTIVE PEACE ADN THEY PROMISE ME WILL REFUND ALL AMOUNT I PAID AND EXCHANGE MONEY WHAT I GET ON MY POCO F 1 PHONE BUT ITS A APPROX 9  DAY THEY DID NOT PAY ME ALL WHAT THEY PROMISE .",2.0 out of 5 stars
3007,"Looks nice, feels nice, is heavy, but can not recommend","This phone arrives in a good sturdy box.<br><br>Pros.<br>1. Looks nice. Feels nice. Is heavy. Glass back is smooth and I love it.<br>2. It's SD888, 120Hz so it is smooth.<br>3. Haptic feedback is good.<br>4. RAM is 8GB and is not expandable.<br>5. Charges really quick. I would say 22-25 mins for 0 to 90%.<br><br>Cons.<br>1. It has only a 4000mAh battery so it discharges quickly too.<br>2. It shows ads when you go to the gallery to see pics. To remove ads there is a monthly $2 subscription for the gallery.<br>3.  In the gallery, you can not just open a pic full screen, go back to the album and open another pic full screen. There is a delay of 2 seconds to show ads every time you go back to the album after opening an image. So it would be really annoying to see many pictures you took one by one. Because you see ads in between them.<br>4. So many unnecessary, unrelated notifications from the v-store that keeps your display cluttered and mind busy while using it. There are times that make me forget while I picked up the phone in the first place while cleaning up the mess on the screen before I begin using it for my purpose.<br>5. Camera is above average at best. The timelapse is not as consistent as other Samsung devices. There would be breakage in the sequence while using the long exposure. It needs to be on Tripod only while using long exposure. No handheld long exposure would make sense to show off or share with others, no matter how steady it would be.",2.0 out of 5 stars
3008,Not at all value for money,"This phone is not at all value for money because after spending so much there is constant problem with all phone call's voice quality. There is no earphone jack if you can't even use collar mics with this phone. The speaker volume is very low so if you have to give online classes this phone is a wrong choice. The phone is heavy &amp; using it for long calls is simply a nightmare. It can give you horrible neck pain &amp; then you have to spend more money and time to get treatment. With Earplugs the voice keeps breaking &amp; ppl on the other side can't hear you clearly and you have to shout constantly. Even a regular phone plays louder videos than this one. No one spends so much money for a just a fingerprint reader. The front camera is just about okay for this much money. If you make videos using front camera better to buy some other phone whose front camera is equal or close to the back camera (higher MP). The pictures come nice though. The only good thing is the smooth UI so u can edit videos and enjoy reading books and sending emails but watching movies with low speaker volume in not fun at all. The phone's low volume can spoil the overall experience. With all the basic problems like speaker, phone calls, poor battery one ends up feeling cheated. So don't buy it especially not the one that comes for 44K but if you buy the one cheaper than 44k then the Ram is only 8GB. So, I feel they should have priced it slightly lower and added some of things that are missing.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Not the best and there a ton of bloatware some can be removed and some not. If you are a person who is not worried about UI please go ahead with the purchase. Cameras are good but the UI is again meh.<br><br>Running into a lot of issues with using apps like google dialer, the app says the phone is not supported.<br>Background processes does not die even if you clear them out. Make a call --&gt;clear all apps--&gt;check for background apps you will still see the phone app :(<br><br>I am using the phone with nova launcher to get a good UI but the phone keeps killing it for some reason unknow.<br><br>Updated to 2 stars.<br>This is a mess and the UI has a loooooad of bugs and I don't expect them to be fixed.<br><br>Retaining 2 stars<br>Phone does not allow third party lauchers to work smoothly.

3040,People went unnecessarily crazy for this Legend Edition.,"I've been using this phone (Legend Edition) for about 2 &amp; a 1/2 months now, all I can say is it's a moderately overrated device. I'll list all the pros and cons I can think of.<br><br>PROS:<br>1) Looks great, eye-catching back cover. Amidst the crowd of blue, pink, cyan, black phones, this one definitely stands out. The back is smudge-proof, upto an extent. 5/5<br>2) Very fast charging. 5/5<br>3) Speakers good enough for me ( though it is considerably lower than my previous phone OnePlus 7). 4/5<br>4) In-display fingerprint scanner and face unlock works fine. 4.5/5<br><br>CONS:<br>1) Battery life is bad. Not extremely bad, but bad. I'm not a gamer or a very heavy user, but I struggle to make it last one whole day. But it charges very fast, so that's a plus point. 3.5/5<br>2) Camera is not that great. But the default Camera app has many features which may be useful to some. I don't know why people say that this has the best camera setup in this price segment, but in my opinion it's not that great. Selfie camera is bad. Also when you open the camera app from the lock screen, it is full of glitches, can't even get to see the shutter many a times. 3/5<br>3) The UI is not that great. You'll get many bloatware you can't uninstall. Gives false notifications also about battery being drained by certain apps which were not even running in the background. 3.5/5<br>4) Notifications are wrong (specially the SMS app). Certain apps don't even show notifications, no matter how hard you try. 1/5<br>5) Phone gets warm when you're charging it, but I guess that's normal when we're using turbo charger.  4/5<br>6) Very slippery side panels. Get a good bumper cover. They provided a silicon cover that was very slippery and turned yellow (looked like it got jaundice) after 7 days. Camera bump will cause scratches unless you're keeping it face-down. 4/5<br><br>My personal verdict: Overrated device. I'd suggest to not go aftwr watching a million unboxing videos, because I'm pretty sure by now that those were paid reviews. I don't want you to agree with me, but I am giving my honest review after buying it with my hard earned money and using it for more than 2 months.<br><br>Thank you.",3.0 out of 5 stars
3041,OVERALL GOOD PHONE BUT HAVE A GREEN TINT WHEATHER YOU INCREASE BRIGHTNESS OR DECREASE IT.,There is green tint issue. Because in my device iQoo7 legend 5G and this is my 2nd second replacement when I apply dark mode along with dark amoled wallpaper it seems to see greenish tint at the top of the notification panel as  I increased the brightness the greenish tint increases  this issue is only been seen on the home screen  when dark wallpaper is applied along with dark mode. Will this get fix via OTA or whether it's an hardware issue.<br>Even increasing the brightness the tint also get increased but only been seen near the notification bar in home screen.<br>Is their any issue with this panel.<br>No issue are seen while watching movies or playing games and surfing the internet.<br><br>This issue is only been seen by applying dark amoled wallpaper and by turning on the dark mode and by going into the dark room.<br>Will this get fixed by an OTA update or it's and hardware issue. Because this is my second replacement for this issue.<br><br>Do every unit have similar issue because my first unit was also having the same issue even after the replacement issue still persist.<br><br>The areas where I have seen green tint issues are.<br>1) When I do a call and lock the phone and then on lockscreen by pulling down the notification bar green tint would be seen.<br>2) By enabling fingerprint in whatsapp the green tint could be seen while unlocking using fingerprint.<br>3) By applying dark amoled wallpaper and by enabling dark mode green tint could be seen near the notification panel in home screen.<br><br>Please iQoo India take this issue seriously. If you have understood what I am telling to say.<br><br>Kindly solve the issue because many of the user's faced similar issue otherwise the phone is awesome. Please try to fix it via an OTA update.,3.0 out of 5 stars
3042,I'm writing this review after 3 months of usage. Please read before buying.,"&nbsp;1. Camera :<br>Pros - Excellent photo and video quality. Image stabilization mode in video is awesome.<br>Cons - Half washed away photos are created at once in a while. Image attached.<br><br>2. Battery :<br>Pros - Full charge in 30 mins.<br>Cons - Full charge not sufficient for one days usage. I am a regular YouTube watcher. I charge twice a day. Battery drains so speed.<br><br>3. Sound :<br>Pros - Nothing so far. Average Call speaker sound.<br>Cons - Media Volumes (YouTube) are very less. I tested the sound volume of same media with OnePlus. This one fails there. I ended up using ear phones.<br><br>4. User Interface:<br>Cons - *Lock screen posters are autoupdated. Unable to modify its settings as it's inaccessible, which is quite irritating. Attached the video.<br>*Feedback app is there , where u can write compliants and attach the images. I provided my fb twice about the photo issues mentioned in point 1 with images. But no response from them. So I felt it's like an eye wash.<br><br>5. Weight :<br>Phone is heavy to hold. Due to which it's highly slippery. The provided glossy back cover has no grip for Antifall. I ended up buying an anti slippery stickers for back cover.<br><br>6. Price :<br> This cell is 40k, which is over value. Does not value for the hype.<br><br>Initially I thought this phone is going to be a market leader after OnePlus.<br>I am a regular OnePlus user (1+2, 1+6t) . After switching to iQoo, i changed my opinion now!<br>My rating would be 3.5/5.",3.0 out of 5 stars
3043,Buy this phone only if u know it well,"First of all there is no headphone jack in the phone.But that's ok since every android company now days copying iphone and skipping it.But other OEMs are giving the typce c converter in the box as a compensation but with iQoo 7 legend u will not get that also. U have to buy it separately to use ur 3.5mm headphone and to get the optimal performance of The Built in Dac Hi-Fi u have to buy an expensive converter to get optimal output of sound.<br>Secondly the phone gets hot in  extreme usage conditions even if they are advertising that there is largest vapour chamber but it is of no use if ur using it in its full potential.<br>At last the performance is good but the Os is bit downside,coz we are not getting the origin os of china but we are getting the fun touch os of vivo phones which is not up to the mark, it is not bad but still not good as origin os of china.<br>And lastly the legend has only 5 ,5G bands which might be concern for some people as it is not sufficient.<br>Thirdly the camera is good for the price.<br>Fourthly, Don't expect good battery life as it is paired with only 4000mah cell which is not sufficient for power hungry sd 888 SoC during my usage I am getting 4-5 hours of screen on time without gaming.<br>The phone is not bad for the price but not the best out there.<br>Conclusion: If u want SD 888 in any cost and performace go with it But if u want stable performance then u should look for something Else as 888 has a lot of heating issue.",3.0 out of 5 stars
3044,Good features but level of customization could have been better,"I moved from a OnePlus 3T to this device and for me it seems like a downgrade even though this device has higher secs and latest tech! The below review is based on a couple of days usage.<br><br>The only good part - The camera is good, haven't used a lot of features while clicking the pictures but in my limited use the picture quality is good.<br>And you won't get a SD888 (other one being Mi 11X Pro) at this price range.<br><br>Now comes the negatives/annoying features and for me there are quite a few....<br>1. The level of customization that one can do on a OP is way more, e.g. - changing the display size, which I don't see in iQOO - here you can only change the font size, high level of wastage of the screen real estate!<br>2. The volume of the earpiece as well as the speaker is pretty low, so expect to face some issues when taking calls outside of your home environment.<br>3. Battery support is good but it drains very fast when using the mobile hotspot.<br>4. The amount of bloatware is pretty annoying. And to top it up there is no way to get rid of it! Why in well would I use their browser or clumsy messaging App?<br><br>Amazon has changed it's policy so there is no way to return the device, so alas I will have to keep using it. Hopefully I will be able to add more to the positive list at a later point in time.",3.0 out of 5 stars
3045,"Not a legend, but a good device with few unfixable flaws","Negatives:<br>Speaker Voulme: It is noticeably low compared to Oneplus 9, S21 Plus and even Samsung M51. Speaker is biggest ket down. U cannot enjoy any videos as the volume is very low. U end up using headphones or BT speaker everytime. Call volume is better than media volume.<br><br>Font Size: Even with largest font size selection, letters size are very small and look very bad on the big screen. Even after downloading paid fonts from playstore and iqoo store, the size is not increasing. We can only change font style but not size.<br><br>Camera:<br>Front Selfie Camera: Average looking shots; background is overexposed. Even after 2 updates issue is still present. After zooming selfies look grainy. Not worth the hype<br>Rear Camera: Macro shots are a hit and miss. Sometimes we get very good macros and sometimes they wont.<br>Overall rear camera consistency is not good even after 2 updates.<br><br>SLIPPERY MOBILE AND SLIPPERY CASE: Both the handset and even the case provided in the box have no grip and is very easy to slip from the hands. Though the case quality is very good and looks stylish, it has zero grip and is useless. I had to buy another grippy case. The handset also has no grip at all.<br><br>USER INTERFACE:<br>Average UI, nothing fancy.<br><br>Apart from these all other features are very good, particularly charging speed is excellent. Superb quality Amoled screen. Battery backup is good. Signal and call quality reception is very good. Games are running buttery smooth.",3.0 out of 5 stars
3046,Battery sucks,If you are buying this device for gaming than don't buy it. If you play while charging the battery charge percent will not increase at all. You have to close the game and charge it. Apart from this there are thousands of bugs in the is itself. Sometime keyboard does not appear and you have to restart the phone. Sometime status bar does not shows the phone hangs. It Cleears all the default apps on its own. Totally frustrated with this phone.,3.0 out of 5 stars

The whites are not that bright enough and looks bit cheap. Even I do have the green tint issue but in practical cases it is perfectly alright. U won't notice it much.<br>Weight and size - The phone feels bit over weight in the hand and it is difficult to reach the corners with one hand. I feel the company should have reduced the screen size. My opinion is biased as I prefer compact phones but the sad thing is no compact phones are in android market now. So iqoo if u are watching this please do consider making compact phones and there are lots of people like me<br>No headphone jack - When u call a gaming phone I feel it's necessary to provide a dedicated headphone jack.<br>Missing pure android experience - The stock android skin on my pixel 2 is still the best android UI I have ever experienced.

3051,Not for gaming,This phone was advertised everywhere as gaming phone but trust me its not a gaming phone. The SD 888 processor is just to show on papers.

I thought this game might not be optimised for this game so I have tested BGMI and frame drops were there too.

Only if they fix the UI issues I think experience of using the phone will be a lot better. Although the phone is still over priced I believe.,3.0 out of 5 stars

3090,Good camera and performance ... battery performance is poor.,To be honest the the performance is good as  expected from a Snapdragon 888 processor screen feels quick and snappy  although not that smooth while gaming like the rotation movement nll is a little bit slow camera is good the only drawback is battery 66 wtt charge is fast but it is cz of the low 4000 mah battery the battery if you are looking for a long lasting battery mobile then think twice before you buy this .,3.0 out of 5 stars

Fast charging. Within 30 mins it goes to 10% to 100%<br>4.

3094,#snapdragon 888,This device have a huge heating isseue with fast bettery drainage in comparison to other gaming priority gadgets of snapdragon 888. Not satisfied with this costy budget with this type of issues. And google says it contains 90 FPS but it doesn't...it gives 60-70 FPS MAX with wifi otherwise you can imagine how much hard it could be for gamers or especially game lovers with tight budget. Its not bad but better than IQ003 thas all can say for now.,3.0 out of 5 stars

Really heavy 206 gms, very difficult to handle in one hand.<br>2. Small battery for the weight, just 4000mah,<br>3. Very poor battery back up. Hardly lasts 8 to 10 hours with normal use.<br>4. Too much of bloatware, u can't uninstall or disable.<br>5. Funtouch 11is a poor UI<br>6. Absence of key features like file safe/private safe folder,<br>7. Highly complicated UI.

Heavy games like genshin impact sucks.<br>4. Charges in 24 mins from 3% to 100%<br>5. Cheap price (32k in republic sale)<br><br>Cons:<br>1. Phone is heavy and slippery to hold even with case. No gorilla glass. So no protection.<br>2. Snapdragon 888 has much heating issue even with normal use. Can't hold the phone because of aluminium frame gets heated like hell.<br>3. Very bad battery backup if heavy user. Atleast charge 2 times a day. 4000 mah for SD 888 chip is very less.<br>4. Funtouch UI is the worst ever. Too much bloatwares and each asking to agree to terms and agreement which takes our data.<br>5. Lagging a lot in first few days. YouTube gets struck often.<br>6. No 3.5mm jack. No cable for type c to 3.5 mm is provided in box.<br>7. Phone can't be rooted and rom can't be cchanged in all IQoo and Vivo.So can't fix the ROM on your own too.<br><br>Overall conclusion :<br><br>Buy this phone if comes to cheap price. Choose IQOO 7 which is 10k price difference but has same screen, camera, big battery and 870 processor which is way lot cooler and stable than 888.",1.0 out of 5 stars
3099,Regret buying this phone,"It's fast due to SD 888 processor, everything else is disappointing. Experience is really bad due to poor Funtouch OS. It's so bad that it doesn't even allow you to change accent color. You are stuck with boring same looking UI forever. Vivo/Iqoo doesn't even allow you to unlock bootloader so you can never install custom roms which means that you will have to bear with the funtouch os forever. Trust me, OS is so bad that it overpowers every good thing about this phone.<br>Other observations after 4 months usage:<br><br>Pros:<br>Decent camera in day light<br>Fast Charging<br>Good Display<br>Good for gaming due to SD888 but multitasking is poor as it keeps closing apps in the background<br><br>Cons:<br>Worst software experience I have ever seen on a mobile<br>Buggy UI, boring grey color notification panel with no support to change accent color<br>Useless software updates with no useful features - This was IQOO's top model at the time of purchase yet such poor software support<br>Poor calling quality - Wifi calling keeps dropping during calls, people on the other side of the call keeps complaining about the poor audio.

While it is a performance phone (ideal for gamers) it can also be used for daily use. Plus there's 120 Hz on tap which makes scrolling / gaming / videos a breeze! Add the additional haptic feedback for gaming.<br>2. It has the equivalent of Gorilla Glass 4 / 5 (a German glass brand that is less well known but equally good). It already comes with tempered glass on it - which is great!<br>3. But above and beyond the specs and the ratings - what blows you completely is the actual physical form-factor of the phone. It is delightful - it is big and it is on the heavier side (takes some getting used to).<br>4. It has a solid build - like a brick. You could literally knock someone out cold with it.<br>5. The finish with the white back and the BMW M stripes are beautiful. It's matt so it will not be a finger-print magnet.<br>6. The build quality is also incredible. While this may sound subjective - let me put it in perspective. I use a S21 Plus and a OnePlus 7T and my daughter uses a S20 FE. This phone's physical form factor in terms of its build quality is as good as any of these phones.<br>7. The speakers are great - better than my S21 Plus that costs double this phone.<br>8. The camera is very good - not as good at the S20 FE or the S21 Plus but better than the OnePlus 7T. It's night mode is very good and normal portrait shots in the day are vivid and punchy (a little on the oversaturated side - like Samsung).<br>THE CON(S)<br>1. The lack of a IP rating is unfortunate but basis my tests, it is definitely splash resistant (also something you can corroborate off YouTube reviews).<br>2. The battery is 4000 Mah so it is unlikely that it'll last a day with even normal use. The saving grace is its huge 67 watt charger that actually charges this phone from 0 to 100 in 25 mins (yes - 25 mins - no exaggeration on that one). Normally people will not wait for their battery to drain out completely - usually plugging it when it reaches 25% or so. Which will take no more than 15 mins to charge!<br>3. The silicon case that comes in the box is good but very slippery. But another one if you have to - one with grooved edges that make holding the phone easy.<br>4. The OS is rudimentary and there is bloatware (some of the unnecessary apps can be deleted). Nowhere close to OxygenOS or even Samsung's OneUI. But personally I don't think this is a deal-breaker.<br><br>VERDICT - Like i mentioned earlier...while I bought this for my son, i was very tempted to buy another one for myself. In my opinion, the pros far out-compensate the cons. It is a phone that I would unhesitatingly recommend to those who appreciate great design; build quality &amp; great specs!!! And it comes at a great price :))",5.0 out of 5 stars

3156,True legend,"Well i cannot say much as I just bought this phone for gaming purpose but wasn't aware that the hardware which is inside this device Is capable of so much more. In terms of gaming you can pick any phone from any price range from market and it will match that performance without any issue. Yes it has some heating problem but it's the know problem with every snapdragon 888 chipset phone even one plus 9 pro has heating issue. Yes it less compared to 7 legend because of simple fact that those phone's performance are locked and this can be checked in benchmarking application score.<br><br>Also don't worry about the heat it has the biggest cooling chamber till now in any phone. So you will be blown away with the cooling speed of this phone. It literally drops 4-5°c in 2-3 mins of inactivity.<br><br>In terms of camera pick any phone in this price point 7 legend will out perform them.<br><br>Let's talk about battery yes it's 4000mah a little less but it won't disappoint you. I play almost 7-8 pubg games in a day in SMOOTH and 90FPS  setting so around 4hrs of gaming along with Instagram and watsapp the phone is connected to wifi 24X7 and for audio i use Bluetooth headset, and guess what i have to charge it twice a day.<br><br>So my suggestion is go for it if you budget is around 30-40k as there is card discount too and great replacment offers.<br><br>CONS : The only problem right now in the phone is it's UI. IT'S GREAT but there are few bugs because of which you will be disappointed. This can be fixed and IQOO if you're listening please give us some fixes on the UI quickly. I know one plus iqoo Vivo all are Chinese brand so do some magic and ship this phone with OXYGEN OS😂 and trust me your phone's will be king in its price segment.<br><br>NOTE : You will only be disappointed if you get a defective unit which is possible. But you can always replace it during the replacement period.",5.0 out of 5 stars
3157,"Best mobile under 40,000","If you are looking for a mobile under 40k then don't think of other options. This is surely the best you can get under 40k. I will now explain Pros and cons of this so that you all can get better idea.<br>Pros:-<br>1. Display<br>This is one of the best displays we can get at this price.colours and brightness are excellent. Indisplay fingerprint is also pretty good and accurate.120hz refresh rate gives you much smoother experience.<br>2. Build Quality<br>Coming to build quality,the in-hand feel looks premium. Front and back it has glass protection and frame is aluminium.so iqoo hasn't compromised anything in build quality point of view.<br>3. Performance<br>Coming to performance,it has the best processor (sd 888) right now in the market. Any high end games like COD, Asphalt 9 it handles very well . No lags or frame drops.<br>4. Cooling System<br>This is also the best thing Iqoo has done. the cooling system is so good that after 40-45 mins of gaming also the cpu thermal management is so good.it feels a bit warm outside but not that much.<br>5. Battery and Fast charging<br>It comes with 4000mah battery and with 66w fast charger we can charge it completely under 27 mins. Moderate user can use this phone for 1 day with full charge. I got Screen on time around 6 hrs.<br>6. Camera<br>Last but not the least, this is one of the reason why I went for this compared to other competitors in this price like OnePlus 9R or Mi11x pro. 48 mp main camera does excellent job in day light or low light. Another advantage is 13mp wide angle camera .this can also be used for taking macro pics .so macro pics are quite amazing compared to other phones having 2mp or 5mp macro camera. The main advantage of cameras is 13mp portrait telephoto lens . You can really capture amazing portrait pics. It also has modes in portrait which are amazing. Coming front camera, it has 16 mp front camera which does the good job as well.<br>7. Virtual Ram Technology.<br>This is also one of the best feature you get in this phone.3gb of your internal storage can be used as Ram.<br><br>Cons:-<br>Every mobile has obviously has some cons. Now let us see the cons I have noticed In my usage.<br>1. Stereo speakers.<br>It doesn't have a dedicated secondary speaker at the top.Earpiece acts as a secondary speaker.it could have been better if they have provided that dedicated speaker at the top.<br>2. Mic Quality in video recording.<br>This is the con for the people who records videos much. Audio recorded via mic is bit low.<br>3. Ui<br>When compared to previous versions of funtouch os present version is pretty good but its not that good compared with oxygen os<br>4. No micro sd card slot<br>Yes flagships won't give you that option.so you have to stick with the internal storage or you can use otg.<br>5. No IP rating<br>As this is the flagship so they could have given atleast IP53 rating but it's not. Though the slots have that rubber seal inside but rating could have added a bit more value for this phone.<br>6. No reverse charging or wireless charging support.<br><br>All these cons are not much of concerns for most of the people so this is the best falgship killer under 40k.",5.0 out of 5 stars

3159,Overall a good spec heavy mobile but lags in software,"I have been using this mobile for almost 2 months. Bought this mobile after a through research.<br>My previous mobile was Samsung Note 9.<br>I don't play games but I am a heavy user with lots of apps and inclined towards performance. It irritates me when phone becomes slow and gets stuck. User reviews has helped me to take a decision and thought to share mine as well for others benefit<br><br>My requirements:<br>Best performace without any lags and can sustain for atleast 3 years<br>Good camera<br>Battery<br>Software exp<br><br>Below is my experience<br><br>Pros<br>-Absolutely fantastic with hardware. No lags.<br>-Camera is too good<br>-Signal reception is good in both network connectivity and Wifi connectivity.<br>-Display is good.<br>- Battery is good. Easily works for one day. Gets charged in almost 35 mins. So no problem at all.<br>- Did not face any heating issue. Though I don't play games but I use lots of apps. My samsung note 9 used to get heated at some point.<br>- Mobile Speaker quality is good. Not very loud but audio clarity is good. This is enough<br><br>Cons<br>- Biggest drawback is in software. This mobile just has a basic software so that u can use this mobile. After using samsung note 9, I feel this is lagging way too behind. Some of the annoying problems are<br><br>- Phone dialer too bad. UI is pathetic and there is no search option in call history. Problem is even Google Phone dialer from playstore does not work in this mobile. Using it everyday really irritates.<br>- Cannot watch any of OTT Vidoes on TV screen by screen casting. Videos don't play on TV screen. Here Samsung works brilliantly.<br>- Cannot group apps in a folder. With so may apps it looks like a junk yard<br>- No in built file manager. Downloading some file manger from playstore will never be perfect. They have given so many bloatwares. I don't know  why they did not give one file manager.<br>- While Connected with bluetooth there is no option to select audio output channel. Sometimes I may need from bluetooth or phone audio or wired audio. This is really problematic while screen casting. Again samsung works brilliantly.<br>- No Bluetooth connectivity interface. Everytime have to go to settings to connect<br>- Limited options to customize themes. Mostly  themes just change color. No major changes.<br><br>Apart from all these, have faced call drops a few times but that's not a very big concern. Mostly it works.<br><br>Overall- I would rate 4.5.  It is a good spec heavy mobile but lags way behind in software. I will still suggest as it gives performance without any lags. If software aspects are improved, this is the best in market.<br>Also priced decently.",5.0 out of 5 stars
3160,Great performer with great camera and very beautiful design!,"Iqoo has given a really very powerful packed smartphone in very low price.<br>I personally bought it for its performance and fast charging.<br>I am reviewing this phone after 2 months of rough use.<br>This phone is really very very powerful. It can run really very heavy apps without any issues. No matter weather you are playing a heavy game or editing a video, you can totally rely on it.<br>I had not much expectations with its camera as it has got enough specifications for its price. But it came out to be really really good. I was shoked by its extreme night mode, portrait mode UHD photos and 4k 60fps video recording. I can always relay on it that no matter what the lighting condition is, it will always delight me by its photos.<br>Its screen is just superb! 120hz refresh rate makes your experience fluid with great colours , super fast touch response, extreme brightness and benefits of amoled display.<br>Haptic feedback on this phone is super cool when typing messages or when playing games. It makes the experience better.<br>I love its pressure sensitive trigger buttons for games. Like I use them to fire in BGMI. I don't have to move my thumb, just put some pressure on the screen.<br>Stereo speakers and amazing on this phone. Very crispy and balanced with a little thumping bass feel!<br>Battery life on this phone is good but its 66watt charging makes it great. Sometimes when the battery is low during gaming, I just plug it in the charger and go for a 10 min walk. And when I come back, I'm good to go for hours!!! 100% charge in just 27 minutes is really really great. I never have to worry.<br>Face unlock in this phone works really well even in very low lighting conditions! I'm delighted with it. And when the lighting conditions are good, it will unlock your phone as soon as you press the power button!<br>Fingerprint sensor is not very great as it is not the fastest I've ever seen but it's still very good though.<br>I love it's UI. It has loads of customisation options. Totally love its animations!<br>And at last, its design.... It is a very beautiful phone. It feels premium as you hold it in your hands. Its white colour with BMW brand strips make it look really cool. And its all covered by a matte finish glass back which makes the in-hand feel very good and protects it from fingerprints.<br>It's not a very heavy phone. And it feels very good to hold in hands.<br>I bet you, you won't find a better phone than this in this price range. Just go for it!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
3161,"Worth Buying  - best for gaming, Photography and performance.",Definitely a great choice for the users looking for camera and optimized day to day performance. phone's ram management is so impressive.<br>No phones in the market stands in front of its camera under this price segment. Awesome camera quality.<br>Display is very crisp and sharp with 120hz Refresh rate HDR videos viewing quality take you to another level.<br>A+ Gaming Support.<br>impressive fast charging.<br>And at the last its design is definitely unique and awesome that never seen before even in the flagship level smart phones that color changing display.<br>i really recommend my friends to buy iqoo smartphones.,5.0 out of 5 stars

3163,Best All rounder in 35K,"An Amazing Smartphone for 35k, writing this review after 10 days of continuous usage.<br><br>Build - It has one of the most unique design for a smartphone, the back and front are glass sandwiched with an aluminium frame, the camera bump is minimal plus it has extra  antenna bands for good connectivity.<br><br>Hardware - The sd 888 on this legend is highly overpowered with no corner cut, I gamed for 3 hours straight and the heating was minimal and there were no lags, the heating chamber is really good to minimize the heat while heavy tasking.<br><br>Display - 120 Hz Fhd display on first look may look normal on first glance but it has higher contrast ratio which gives even better punchy colours. My unit has no green tint issue.<br><br>Camera - being launched as gaming smartphone it has really good camera setup 48+13+13 is a triple camera setup but works as quad camera with ultrawide also working as macro thus no useless 2 mp camera unlike most of smartphones in this price range. Front camera is 16 MP and is good enough and finely tuned for good detailed photos.<br><br>Gaming - 10/10 absolute beast in terms pf gaming<br><br>Battery - 4000Mah may look less for a gaming phone at first glance but i easily got regular 5 hours of gaming at hdr extreme settings. For normal usage it's gives you easy one day battery. Charging is absolutely phenomenon on this device in my usage it always took less than 25 min for full charge.<br><br>Connectivity - real nice connectivity for 4G, I got 40 Mbps plus in my village for LTE Network, it has carrier aggregation and works well if the place supports it.<br><br>Audio - This might be the only drawback of this phone. It has dual stereo speakers, sound quality is good but loudness is a little low, it doesn't has 3.5 mm jack but through adapter it supports high res audio which provide excellent output.<br><br>Software - funtouch os 11 is really improved the software is really stable the only irritating part is bloatware and vivo app store which send ads which you should turn off in the beginning<br><br>Additional - a little tip while you boot this smartphone for first time do check every agreement at the startup, for reference check 'beeboom' video for different os for clean setup.<br><br>Overall a great phone for the price segment worth the buy and not disappointed at all.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I play CoD, PUBG, sideswipe at highest FPS and processor can handle them very well. It gets a bit warmer when playing for long hours.<br>There is a slight delay in fingerprint scanner but u can substitute it for Face ID which is very fast. Charging time is also very good.<br>Display is nice and crisp.<br>Stereo speakers are bang-on<br>There are few bugs in funtouch OS, I really miss the stock android.<br>I got this smartphone for 34k.

3168,It's not perfect but still one of the best you can get at this price,"I have extensively used MI phones earlier so I will post my reply keeping them as benchmark.<br>Pros<br>- This phone handles sd888 better than anything, no heating whatsoever<br>- A lot of people will tell you that sd888 is a waste for you if you are not a gamer.... This is wrong, it enhances your overall experience and a flagship processor is must if you want to own a phone for &gt;2yrs (as per my experience)<br>- Amoled screen is awesome and animations are very smooth with adaptive refresh rate, no need to keep it at 120hz always<br>- Pictures are awesome, just install gcam, it takes 5 minutes and will deliver quality pics for years (my apk doesn't have the dedicated zoom switch, not sure if they are supporting zoom lense)<br>- Charging is super fast, 0 to 100 in less than 25 mins and it doesn't heat the battery a lot, not missing the 120 watt charger at all<br>- If you have a 3G sim (BSNL), then it has a 3G only mode which works much better than 3G preferred mode in Mi phones<br>- Supports 5 5G bands so it's definitely not a gimmick here<br>- My device doesn't have any issues with the call hold lags or any calling issue, maybe it was fixed in the latest update<br>- Build quality is awesome due to the aluminium frame, feel premium<br>- comes with a screen protector pre installed<br>- fingerprint reader is decent<br><br>Cons<br>- Heavy to hold, if you have small hands consider something else or buy a grippy cover<br>- Battery is small although battery life does seem decent<br>- Funtouch OS is not all that fun, but you can uninstall all the bloatware except 2 (not considering the optimization apps, calculator etc), these 2 can also be reduced to mere icons within a few clicks. Jovi home also needs to be ignored.<br>- I miss the headphone jack and they didn't give a covertor in box<br>- Pressure sensitivity is not used anywhere apart from games<br><br>Overall, you need to put some effort to make it better it's not perfect but the best you can get at this price ( always buy with that 3k/2k coupon offer)",5.0 out of 5 stars

3170,Best value for money phone with Top performance!,"I switched to this phone from Samsung Note 20 Ultra which was 3 times the price by the way. Most worrying point for me was camera quality at time of purchase since i knew that IQOO 7 legend has the best in market - SD888 chip, so performance will not be an issue at all.<br><br>Phone is superb when it comes to charging time = 22-24 minutes from 1% to 100%. I have timed it several times and it charges consistently. (Don't use the phone in this time though, otherwise it will take more time to charge).<br><br>Camera = IQOO 7 legend takes pretty ready to use photos which do not require any/much editing. Its AI is also nice to take best optimized photos as per the scene/lighting around.<br><br>Video recording = Its very stable and satisfactory till 1080p (30 and 60 fps), however 4k could be improved. It lacks OIS stabilization in 4k...its a much needed feature since the chip inside can even support upto 8k recording, so i hope we get this issue sorted out through software update later.<br><br>Battery life = Average - i get around 4 hours screen on time while phone is charged almost every 22-24 hours.  I expected better battery life but its fast charging makes things even, so won't complain much.<br><br>Build quality = Solid. Premium. Made of aluminium. Sturdy build.<br><br>Display = Brightness is right at flagship level and as good as my Note 20 Ultra which says a lot good about IQOO 7 legend's display. I have no complaints from it.<br><br>Audio = Dual speakers are Average. They could have been louder.<br><br>To conclude, if you are getting IQOO 7 legend 12 GB variant for Rs.40000 (after coupon/discount/cashback etc.), then its a pretty good deal in my opinion and i find it a true value for money phone especially when compared to OnePlus 9 Pro or Mi 11 Ultra or Vivo x60 Pro+ ....all these phones literally cost Rs.20,000 - 30000 more and don't really add much to such a big difference in the cost honestly.",5.0 out of 5 stars

3172,Great Phone if you can get it around 35k or below.,"Been using this for 6 days now. And I have only one regret but I doubt this will be applicable to overwhelming majority of buyers. Let's get that out of the way first, I like rooting my phones, sadly this can't be rooted as Vivo is a one of the most egregious offenders of open source nature of Android and won't allow bootloader unlock. But their value oriented Sub brand iQoo has come a long way from iQoo 3 days.<br><br>This phone is undoubtedly the best value for money flagship at a prmeum mid-range price available right now. Got it for less than 35k with discounts. Wanted to wait for realme GT but they seem to be taking their sweet time to release that phone in Indian market. That being said let me sum up the review with list of pros and cons.<br><br>Pros:<br>1. Flagship Snapdragon Processor<br>2. Great camera hardware setup with OIS.<br>3. Premium build and design.<br>4. Premium looking 120Hz OLED screen5<br>5. Clear and loud call quality and very good cellphone signal reception. So good internet speeds. Suports wifi 6 as well.<br>5. A lot more improved and Closer to Stock Android UI.<br>6. Great Haptics.<br>7. Sufficiently loud and clear stero speakers.<br><br>Cons.<br>1. Lack of 3.5 mm jack so can't utilize that Hi-Res onboard DAC with earphones.<br>2. Front camera processing softens/beautifies human skin for no reason, hope iQoo fixes this with an update in future.<br>3. Relatively small battery capacity for 2021 standards , surprisingly it's cheaper sibling iQoo 7 gets 10% better battery capacity than this. The fast charging speed makes up for it though so not that big of a con.<br>4. No SD card slot.<br>5. No OIS for video, this is baffling omission but doesn't affect my usage as I rarely shoot videos and even in those rare cases I won't be missing it as I won't be shooting it while runnig or something, so this con is at the very last.",5.0 out of 5 stars

3175,Flagship Beast Redefined,"Review after one week of use.<br><br>I love gaming and have been waiting for a SDM 888 under 40k which does not compromise on any aspect, and now i finally have it in my hands and its a Gaming Beast.<br><br>The super 1000 Hz touch sampling rate makes up for buttery smooth game control. For all mobile gamers, pls have a look at the touch sampling rate as that determines more your response times, even more than screen refresh rate.<br><br>Camera Again, since I love making travel videos, and have been using an iPhone 11 for the past one year, this has been a welcome change, with its saturated and punchy images and videos that are a treat to the eye. For vlogs in outdoor scenarios, audio used to become an issue, however zoom feature really helps reduce background noise and focus on the subject. No need to carry a separate mic!<br><br>I have always liked soft bright colors on my gadgets and so like the legend's aesthetic look. Considering the hardware it packs the phone is surprisingly light and slim.<br><br>As for the user interface which is Funtouch OS.  this phone has the cleanest version of Funtouch OS yet. However being a nerd, I never shy away from the plethora of custom ROMs that popular devices get over at XDA, and this I am sure is going to be a blockbuster one. SO that's something up to try in the future!!<br><br>Not getting good brand type c earphones to use with it. So 3.5 mm earphone with a local type c connector doing the job as of now.<br>Humble request to iqoo to have typeC earphones, type C splitter and type c aux cable assesories in store to purchase by the users. I know at this price providing them with phone is not possible so kindly add it to your store for purchase separately.",5.0 out of 5 stars
3176,Excellent Device 👍,"Generally, when I buy a phone it's with the consideration that I'm going to use it for atleast the next 3-5 years. So it is quite a task to find one which is a value proposition and can last well all those years.<br>I'm an occasional gamer but more importantly, I needed a mobile computing device that can efficiently handle all my official, multimedia and general requirements.<br>You'll find many YouTubers mention it's tech specs in quite a lot of detail, so I'm just gonna stick to my experience of using the device.<br><br>What I really LIKE about this phone:<br>1. Excellent Screen - very good and vibrant colours, real viewing pleasure.<br>2. Sound - Though I've read some people commenting here that the sound is average, in my opinion, it's Loud, Clear and Crisp. The max volume level is good enough and did not notice any audio distortions even at the highest volume.<br>3. Camera - Loads of features to explore, experiment and better your shots. The ""Mirror Image"" option while taking selfies (even in video mode) is useful.<br><br>What can be IMPROVED:<br>1. Battery - With very normal usage too, I'm getting just about a day's backup. Though the FlashCharge feature is great, it would have been better if the battery size was 4500 mAh atleast.<br>2. Keyboard - I find the arrangement of the keys is slightly crunched up. Maybe it's because I'm still getting used to it.<br>2. Case/Cover - The flexible cover that comes with the phone is good and has good aesthetic appeal. However, it's quite SLIPPERY and I fear that my phone may drop off. Hence, had to get another one.<br><br>Haven't played much games yet, will update this review when I do.<br><br>In conclusion, it's a real beauty as you get flagship specs without compromising on future connectivity. Hopefully, it'll be 5G compliant when it's launched in India. Happy with the device.",5.0 out of 5 stars
3177,Best phone under 40 k,I upgraded from Redmi K20 pro. This device is a performance beast. Better than any device in this price range. Great build quality. In gameing  I play only PUBG and the device really performs great and I experienced no heating issues. I think the vapour chamber works really well. Display is very crisp and bright. Cameras are at flagship level. And the Battery lasts a day on moderate usage and drains on gameing but its ok becoz the charging is incredibly fast and that makes it even. I got confused is it really 100 or not.<br>.<br>My friend have a onplus 9R and this phone outperforms in every department except battery. U get roughly 30 to 40 mins extra on oneplus 9R  but the charging outperforms. 9R can't  match with the gaming and camera performance. Coming to software i actually like the software experience becoz I want  that gameing mode and all becoz during gameing especially pubg i use wats app.<br>.<br>Coming to design its totally subjective and I personally like the design as am a BMW fanboy and it will stand you out in a crowd.<br>.<br>Phone is on the heavier side. But it's ok for me becoz  it gives good in hand feel. Premium phones all are heavy. Not good for one hand usage.<br>.<br>I recommend this phone for gamers and age below 30 years.<br>.<br>The protection case is very slippery and no protection for the cameras. you might want to change the case.<br>.<br>Battery is very good but not best in 2021.<br>Over all its a great product. Well done IQOO. Will update after 2 month usage.,5.0 out of 5 stars

3179,High performance phone,"I have been an avid fan of OnePlus phones since they launched for the fact that they provided high performance Flagship level specs with minimal bloatware (Oxygen OS is closest to stock) at cutthroat prices. But lately they have upped the prices and have (unnecessarily) launched multiple variants while compromising on specs. This is where iQoo enters.<br>The iQoo 7 Legend is a fantastic piece of hardware at slightly better prices than OnePlus (once the prince of flagship killers). Camera doesn't disappoint either. Fingerprint scanner is better than expected and the phone unlocks within a fraction of a second. While the battery capacity could have been 4500mAh instead of 4000mAh, it's fast charging capabilitirs (0-100% in 30 mins approx) is the best I have seen till date. The only downside being the OS which has more bloatware compared to OnePlus which is a rather ignorable annoyance. But at the price it is being offered, I would prefer the iQoo over OnePlus.",5.0 out of 5 stars
3180,Camera is awesome,,5.0 out of 5 stars
3181,Value for money... The New OnePlus,This is for those who are looking for high end specs with reasonable price... This is what OnePlus started off with but somehow lost track midway fighting for number one spot with big tech companies.... IQOO is filling up that sweet spot that OnePlus was supposed to capture... Perfomance is really good considering it has 888 snapdragon processor. In short look no further... This is a good buy if get it on discount now as there are updated versions available IQOO 9 etc....,5.0 out of 5 stars
3182,Amazing phone at an unbeatable price.,"I was among the few people who pre ordered this device, used Amazon's ICICI credit card and availed 3000rs discount in addition to Amazon's 2000 rs discount, got this phone @35000, I have been using this phone for more than 1month and i really liked  my decision of buying iqoo7 legend, have been a xiaomi user for quite sometime now, however i was attracted by the top notch specifications offered at an unbeatable price. Phone stands out in the crowd.<br>Pros:-<br>1)Processor- Snapdragon 888, performance is seemless.<br>2) camera- 48 mp camera is awesome,  additional 13mp telephoto lens is a bliss, which other phones are not offering. They are offering either a macro or depth sensor. But its telephoto lens is portrait sensor too, wide lens is again an advantage. Whole camera set up is amazing.<br>3) charger - first of all they are offering a fast charger which is insane when it comes to charging your phone 0-100 in less than 30min. So now u dont need to worry about running out of juice when u can carry this charger with u.<br>4) looks- OMG, this phone is a stunner and stand-out in the crowd,the three stripes at the glass back is stunning and bmw branded back case is of ok quality but serves the purpose.<br>5) Display:- Amoled display is awesome, brightness is next level, no problem in operating the phone in direct sun light, display is crisp and punchy. 120hz makes the operation smoother.<br><br>Cons:-<br>few bugs are there, that can be sorted via an update and company is trying to fix it with timely updates.<br>Apart from that i am very much happy with my purchase and the value this phone is offering.",5.0 out of 5 stars

But after purchase, I am super happy and loving that I made a right choice.<br>Pros:<br>- Camera quality is best in the range<br>- Battery life for my daily usage is very good. Mostly around 50% of battery is consumed in whole day for me and charging time is super quick. Within 25mins to 30mins full charge from 0%. on new purchase Thats really quick.

It is good, but slippery. Chances of slipping from hand is more using the provided back cover.

3189,Wonderful Device...!!!,"Iqoo 7 Legend is really a wonderful device. I was using Oneplus device from a couple of years and it was very hard to shift from Oxygen OS.

Here are the Pros:<br><br>- You will get almost everything what Oxygen OS offers.

Its really really fast. Same goes for face unlock.<br>- Cameras are very good. No useless lenses. You get proper 3 lenses including telephoto.<br>- Battery backup is accurate. Getting little over a day as I dont play games and usage is average time with dual sim n data always on.<br>- Battery charging time is exactly 22 mins. If you are experiencing more time then check your voltage. In case of more voltage it applies some sort of protection and charging speed is reduced. If I charge it in office where voltage is proper it takes exactly 22 mins, but at home its taking 30+ mins which is not bad either.<br>-What left, build quality is perfect. Screen Protector is already applied.<br><br>Overall score - 9.5/10<br><br>Cons:<br>- One thing I miss is notifications on Ambient Display like in Oxygen OS.

3203,The phone is just wow 😍😍,If u have 40k budget ..I can bet..u will not regret after purchasing it .. performance wise the phone is super fast ..I have tested pubg and pes 2021 ..both r running like buttery smooth ...haptic touch is awesome ❤️ ..<br><br>Secondly camera - IQ didn't comprise with camera ...the day light shots and night mode shots r awesome ❤️ .. especially if u click night mode shots u won't believe the photos in ur own eyes the photos that will be processed by IQ camera .. seriously it's truly awesome..people with negetive comments about camera especially needs a dslr in smart phone ... Trust me guys I have clicked some pictures at 11:00 pm which I uploaded and the pics r truly amazing.. though I am not a pro photographer but IQ 7 legend camera managed to give some good pics even at dark ..<br><br>Third charging -- when it comes to charging the phone is blazing fast 🤟 .. I plugged into charging and went to smoke weed and came back within 15 mints .. the phone took 15 mints to charge my phone from 26 - 100% ... I am impressed with the charging speed ..<br><br>The things which I dislike is the phone is heavy and u can't play games 1 HR at a stretch ..u have to take break for at least 2 mints to give rest to ur hands ... The cover is very sleepy .. 85% chance of dropping the phone  .... Though it has dual speaker but the sound quality is not up to the mark but still it is manageable ..sound clarity is good .. that's all,5.0 out of 5 stars
3204,*editing after 2 month of uses*,this phone is comes with great features.<br>as need lots of improvement it may come after some update ( MI PHONES YOU CAN CREATE DUAL APP MEANS ALMOST EVERY but this phone they have clone with limited features like social media thats it)<br><br>1) FAST CHARGING WITH GOOD BATTERY LIFE (5/5)<br><br>2) I PERSONALLY COMPARED CAMERA QUALITY WITH ONE PLUS 9 SO IQOO 7 IS WINNER .<br><br>3) IF YOU ARE HEAVY GAME PLAYER THIS PHONE FOR YOU. AND IF YOU ARE NORMAL DONT PLAY GAME JUST SOCIAL MEDIA OFFICE WORK ND OTHER STUFF THIS IS DEFINATELY FOR YOU.<br><br>i used to have mi phone poco phones earlier but frankly speaking mi phone have lots of features compare to iqoo7. took me almost 5 days to understand all other features but now i think my selection is not bad i am okay with this phone.<br><br>7 days of use after closing my replacement window i am writing this review.<br><br>if you really want good quality phone with best charging and best camera quality so go with this.<br><br>**********************************************<br>start heating very very badly . like sometime it feel it ll blast anytime dont know why ..<br>this mobile is not worth as compare to one plus .. i think i wasted my money on it .,5.0 out of 5 stars
3205,High performance value phone for the price,"Gamers will love the phone. its a gamers phone without question. I used oneplus 5 Pro for 3+ years, i still love that phone for the size and weight. it is still an amazing phone. Oneplus phones in recent years have got expensive. I found IQ to be a great value alternate, High performance value phone for the price!!<br><br>Pros -<br>-build quality is top notch. metal body.<br>-ultra fast. boots in under 15 sec.<br>-camera is great. especially portrait mode which gets a 50mm equivalent lens.<br>-can load 40 - 50 apps without worrying about performance for days. i reboot once in a 2 weeks, that too just for the heck of it, no real reasons.<br>- feels great to hold.<br>-sound is good for the size of speakers.<br>-clarity of movies and photos is good. (don't compare with Sony)<br><br>Neutral<br>-battery life is good in normal usage. I can pull thru 24 hrs at ease. Hotspot drains the battery real quick in 8 hrs.<br><br>Cons<br>-Display is good for normal usage(gaming, movies etc), but if you are buying the phone to pixel peep or you are a photographer, be warned. Display has green tint. guess need to calibrate  the display. no luck.",5.0 out of 5 stars

3207,Look before you Leap 🤓,"I have been using IQOO 7 LEGEND for almost a month and below is my use case scenarios and their evaluation while also comapring to its nearest competitors.<br><br>1) The design is a good one surely. The matte white back panel coupled with matte metal side frame give the IQOO 7 Legend a very premium look and feel. Overall the best design in its segment.<br><br>2) The part of phone that one mostly interacts is its screen or display. In this aspect the IQOO 7 legend is pretty good. The brightness is very good indoor and outdoor alike. The high refresh rate of AMOLED bring good color and contrast while giving a smoother experience. On the other hand the default color setting gives the display an annoying 🔵 blue tint but switching color to professional mode makes things way better. Also it does not show HDR in neither Netflix or Prime video. Overall OnePlus 9R and mi 11x pro have better displays than 7 legend.<br><br>3) The camera on this phone is pretty good as it has been burrowed from its cousin Vivo x60 pro. The daylight performance of the rear cameras is very good in daylight and descent in low light scenarios. Do have a look at the images I have attached. The only problem is with human subjects as the camera smoothens the skin excessive giving a doll like look even without any filters. Also in certain low light conditions the images are slightly yellowish. The rear camera is certainly among the BEST under 50k.<br>The front one of OnePlus 9R and Samsung S20 FE 5G is better. Overall s20 FE 5G also does the best with human subjects and portraits under 50k.<br><br>4) The video taken in 1080p in rear camera is good in well lit conditions while it does a OK job in low light. 4K videos from rear cameras are shaky and lack detail because of absence of OIS.<br>The front camera can max record at 1080p and is descent at best. Overall the s20 FE 5G and mi 11x pro give better videos.<br><br>4) The audio setup though stereo one suffers from low loudness. The sound is descent at best from speakers. The sound from headphones is very good. I prefer the speakers of 9R or s20 Fe 5G or even mi 11x pro over iqoo 7 legend.<br><br>5) With SD888 processor , UFS 3.1 storage and LPDDR5 RAM, the IQOO 7 legend looks like a BEAST on paper 📜. Yeah the horrible Funtouch OS just kills the experience . The phone freezes/ hangs in basic tasks like during a call or switching between apps quickly !!! Worse part is that to make the phone respond it again one needs to manually RESTART it ! Also there are many bloatwares like vivo app store and Jovi home that one cannot remove/uninstall. Also if you read the terms and conditions of the VIVO apps , there are a few points that raise eyebrows and appear suspicious. Also most data is stored in China so trade wisely. Overall, Samsung's One UI and OnePlus's One UI are miles ahead. While MIUI is worse than Funtouch OS, Oppo's Color OS is way better than both.<br><br>6) Battery life is OK, like 5-6 hrs of screen on time. The charging speed of IQOO 7 Legend is phenomenal as it charges 0-100 within 30 minutes, The FASTEST in the segment and even beats the 9R by 7-8 mins, Amazing !!!<br><br>If you have read till now, you must be interested in IQOO 7 LEGEND. I would agree with you that on paper the phone is a beast on paper while the real world usage leaves a lot to be desired especially in SOFTWARE front. The IQOO 7 LEGEND can be your dream phone on a budget albeit a few compromises. So fix your priorities first and then decide on whether to go for it.<br><br>Hope I was informative and helpfull and cheers 🥂 to your new phone. Peace✌️.",4.0 out of 5 stars
3208,MUST READ BEFORE YOU BUY .,"Hello guys.<br><br>Its a big review. U have to read full to get complete pros and cons .<br><br>Firstly i have been a avid used of one plus.<br><br>One plus one<br><br>One plus 3t<br><br>One plus 6t<br><br>Till here oneplus was good and never settled but then things start to change. They forgot their tagline.  ""NEVER SETTLE"" they made us settle indeed. Giving 2 versions of each mobile model 7 , 7 pro and 7t 7t pro I was confused and waiting what to buy but one plus 6t kept on better even after 2.5 years . Now i needed more performance and memory so In search of a phone which is definitely not confusing never settle one plus shifted my focus to other phones and iqoo caught my attention.<br><br>Now the review.<br><br>Body quality is good. Not sure about scoott extension protection but i saw in some reviews its equal to gorilla 5 which is on one plus 9 pro . ( Please correct me if im wrong ) and then the display is good. 120 hz is like butter smooth . It takes time to adjust to this much snoothness. After coming from a 60hz display its a major update.<br><br>Speaker being a stereo dual could have been better . A bit louder. But in earphones its super good. As i dont use phone without earphones this may not be a problem for videos . especially youtube videos are bit lesser output. Ring and music is better than video quality.<br><br>I haven't noticed any green tint or pink tint.<br><br>Then coming to gaming loads of options to make the gameplay even better. The haptic feed back is super cool. And then the cameras are good im not a pro camera enthusiast but still does a good work better than one plus 6t . Its an upgrade for me. Selfies are also good. Low light is also fine for me .<br><br>Facial unlock and indisplay finger print scanner are very fast.<br><br>Charging speed is super fast . 27 minutes is all it takes to go from 10 -95.<br><br>Easily get a screen on time of 7 hours with my usage. (Differs with ur usage ) .<br><br>Coming to Os . Here funtouch os is a bit letdown. That too coming from oneplus  oxygen OS i can feel the downgrade. Oxygen os is next to stock experience and almost zero bloat ware....here in funtouch it may be better than the other versions and might have been upgraded but tonn of bloatware which cant be uninstalled . This can be changed in next updates based on negative reviews. But its 50% to stock android .the notification bar and all are stock.<br><br>This is my personal review. And based on price i got the 12+256 at 38990 . Which is 5000 less than the original price and its a deal.<br><br>No regrets after usage of 4 days.<br><br>Except for os there is no problem and i got habituated to the os also no issues.<br><br>Thanks.",4.0 out of 5 stars
3209,Beauty Outside.. Beast Inside..,"Where do I start on this...  Let's start with Drawbacks..<br>1. Sound Quality was not that great but it's ok. None needed stereo speaker in their hands.😜<br>2. Battery could've been bigger but the way it provides the support is fine. Am getting atleast 8hrs of battery life with continuous screen on time. But in longer run I don't see that will happen.<br>3. Full brightness mode I guess none will use as 1300 nits will be too much to see in home. Why am including here is, it sometimes reduces it and enhance it. am not sure on which purpose that happens.<br>4. 120hz touch sampling is its own enemy when comes to touch. It misbehaves..<br>5. Weight is kinda annoying but I don't see other way around to handle such premium in low cost.<br>6. Headphone jack missing, and this is big drawback...<br>7. And the case they provide by default is also its own enemy.. it slips from hand like anything and makes mobile bulky as well.<br>8. Software looks bit old but am not geek..<br>9. Homescreen buttons response is not that great.. Bloat ware could've avoided as this is premium outside and garbage inside kind of feel would've Eleminated..<br>10. WiFi switched on although am on hotspot. That's kinda bug seems..<br>11. On screen thumb scanner is not that great as company or websites claimed. It's not that fast..<br><br>Now let's see the Pros.<br>1. Quality of the mobile. I mean physical appeal.<br>2. Camera is better compared to most of the rivals<br>3. Gaming is excellent<br>4. As shown in lots of videos, battery is not weak though it has only 4000 mah but has the power to sustain with heavy duty without compromising quality..<br>4. Many guys are talking about green tint, which I feel is the way they purposely designed it to differentiate from black background and icon bar. As far as I know it's not a bug nor issue. People wantedly highlighting it..<br>5. Screen On high brightness looks sexy and it can withstand few ramifications I guess.<br>6. S888 processor does heat up but every mobile has that. Apart from it, performance never compromised here.<br><br>Verdict: I see people claimed it has green tint issue. Battery draining faster than expected. Camera not working, flickering screen etc .. No these are all made up by people unless they received a bug handset these are false claims. It's an outright super or I would say superior performer 40K segment..  I only felt bad with sound and weight.. Battery no it's not an issue at all..",4.0 out of 5 stars
3210,Flagship Make-up,"Not the perfect phone, but definitely a worthy consideration given the price. The phone looks stylish than any Android phones in market. I haveen using it for more than 3 months now and I never faced the issue of lagging. The RAM space is more than adequate. The phone initially seems like a flagship killer but after long use i understand that it's only a flagship Make-up on the phone.<br><br>The cons definitely overtake the pros. First is the UI interface which is worst with lot of unintended apps and options. It's understandable for new phone in market and we are also given options to mute or delete them. Second issue is the brightness settings of phone. The screen brightness is not recommended for low light as it hurt your eyes. Next would be the poor support the UI provides even for Google apps. I see YouTube lagging, not boz of RAM but because of the poor apps support. Every video in any third party apsa lags and only the audio plays. This is the worst experience I have had with any phone I've previously owned. Last but not the least is the batter life which is worst. I've stopped playing games as the battery would die in less than a hour. With minimal usage I'm only able to push for upto 9 to 10 hours of phone usage on single charge which is worse in current standards.<br><br>Verdict. - Great phone for secondary usage (store contacts or have a second social account or if you want a feel of Android)<br>Worst phone if you want to use this for your daily usage.  Prefer Mi phones at this price point, they are much better.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Camera is average as you can see from the pictures I've shared. Battery backup is bad but it has fast charging so I'm fine with it. It is an overkill for gaming, better to stick with some 20-25k range phone cause this is too much power that no game will use. In short: Just buy a 20-25k phone cause all of its features are identical to that range of phone except for its processor and this snapdragon 888 is too much power that no game on phone will use, it only gives you heating and lesser battery backup.",4.0 out of 5 stars

While the notifications can be muted it's impossible to disable. The phone also comes with Moj and apps like that pre-installed but ofcourse they can be uninstalled.<br>3-Lack of Oleophobic Coating on Display : It's a fingerprint magnet.<br>4-Slippery Back : With or Without backcover it's slippery. You have to go for a seperate third party case.<br><br>Near Miss:<br>1-Camera : While it is best, it's not great. The main shooter does great job in ideal lighting scenarios but low light can be a bit tricky but in this price range I doubt if there is another choice this good.<br>2-No headphone jack : It's becoming a fashion to lose out on headphone jack.

3216,Very good hardware with mediocre software experience,"Review after 1 month of usage:<br>Pros:<br>1. Ultra smooth 120HZ screen.<br>2. Great battery life with fast charging. It easily gives 5hrs of screen time even while using in 120hZ mode<br>3. No heating issues as with other snapdragon 888 phones. The cooling system in this phone is excellent.<br>4. Pretty good camera system in this price range.<br>5. Nice build quality with cool looking design<br>6. Speakers are loud enough.<br>7. No issues with connectivity too.<br>Cons:<br>1. Software/UI. Coming from Oxygen OS, my software experience with this phone is not at all good. I faced some weird bugs in software after 2 weeks of purchase. Most annoying among them was the battery percentage display bug. The device's battery percentage is displayed as 1%  randomly in between while using the phone, even though the actual percentage is around 60-80. It stays at 1% for hours while using and then suddenly goes back to its actual percentage in between.<br>2. Lots of preinstalled bloatware and heavily intrusive system apps like Vivo browser etc. Third-party pre-installed apps can be uninstalled directly. But you have to use ADB to uninstall apps like the Vivo browser. Once uninstalled, the overall experience improved a lot.<br><br>Final Verdict:<br>IQOO 7 legend has one of the best hardware for a phone in this price range, but the overall software experience is not great. I hope IQOO improves on their UI in the coming years. Overall pretty good value for money phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3218,Best all-rounder in 30 to 40k range.,It's best in 30k to 40k range. I'm a long time OnePlus and Samsung user so my review is based on comparison to those two company's products.<br><br>Pros.<br>1. Very good camera compared to mi11x and OnePlus 9r.<br>2. Funtouch os is very stockish and very smooth and fluid.<br>3. Fast charging is truly blazing fast. It charges switched off phone from zero to 100 in 23 minutes. And switched on from 10 to 100 in 25 minutes.<br>4. Display with 120hz is good and plenty bright outdoors. But not as good as my previous samsung galaxy display which was QHD but 60hz.<br>5. Haptic motor hardware of this device is fantastic.<br><br>Cons.<br>1. 4000mah battery is small and battery life is average. I get 5 hour SOT on average.<br>2. There are some annoyances in funtouch os like ads and bloatware which I have removed with adb. But some things are just weird like there's vibration feedback when opening some apps or settings but not all. Some animation differences when swiping up for home fast vs slow.<br>3. Vibration feedback is not that well implemented. Though vibration motor is very good and typing on keyboard provides nice tactile feel but it's implementation throughout UI is not that great. In contrast miui has implemented vibration feedback very nicely throughout UI like when increasing volume.<br>4. I also have green tint issue for which I'm gonna have it replaced.,4.0 out of 5 stars
3219,Decent overall experience,"Out of the box i was really disappointed with the buggy and clunky os which like a fake android almost. But i got two subsequent updates including Android 12 which have made the os experience much better and more like a oneplus phone. Lot of youtubers say that bloatware can be deleted but still there is lot of stuff that we can't delete without adb tools. Apart from these minor issues, the phones working great.. camera is great and better than the one plus 7t i was using.<br><br>Edit: after a week of use i can see that the software has a lot of minor bugs.. not upto the standards of oneplus or samsung.

This phone has the darkest blacks which is very much appreciated when you watch in complete dark.<br>* Performance beast. So far haven't found any lag whatsoever<br>*Charges very fast - takes about 35-40 mins for a full charge<br>Amazing camera. Especially the portrait camera is too good. Although not the best camera around, the photos come out surprisingly good.<br><br>Cons:<br>* Very average battery life. With my usage and gaming it lasts 12-15 hours (90% to 20%)<br>* Camera punch hole: not the smallest punch hole compared to other phones. Also the punch hole has a silver ring around which can cause distraction sometimes.<br>* Placement of fingerprint reader. It is placed far too low. This is especially problematic when using single handed. You get used to it though but I wish they had put a little thought on this.<br>* Absence of 3.5mm jack<br><br>The screen protection is a question mark, which is not the industry top spec. Also the 120hz refresh rate is yet to impress me having come from a 60hz lcd screen.<br><br>1 month update:<br>* Found a minor bug in a game, related to touch point focus<br>* Battery lasts 1 day with heavy usage<br>* The notch still feels annoying<br><br>8 months update:<br>* The latest software update has affected the performance of auto dimming feature. Even in complete darkness it doesn't dim the screen as it used to. Couple other issues related to this.<br>* The cameras has a document scan option but didn't work well.

3223,OnePlus6 to IQOO7 Legend,"It is been 15 days since I've moved from OnePlus 6 (3.5 years), the transition from op6 to Iqoo7 was not that great. Few basic things like file manager app was not readily available. That made me think 🤔 about funos and iqoo. (One more incident at same day I've bought this phonetook place ,my 2 year old kid put the phone into talkback mode) I literally tried every other way but unfortunately can't disable that and took the phone to nearest vivo service center to disable that. These things doesn't bring good thoughts about this phone.<br>Then slowly I've started liking this phone, 120htz refresh rates,HDR, camera's,Processor mighty 888, and the rate which I got this was all a big plus( 32k) was a big plus. I'm still getting used to fun os all in all it was a good trade off.<br>Tried gaming few occasions during my usage experience was ok, off late I'm getting good battery backup.

3224,Best phone if you can live with cheap display and Funtouch OS,"After Replacement<br>Edit: Got the replacement. I had somewhat horrible experience with the original product.<br>Camera: I got mine for about 38k/-. Boy if everything works out as they were intended to, IQOO 7 Legend is undoubtedly the BEST smartphone in under 40k/- segment. I can't stress this enough. My sis uses an iPhone 12 Mini and believe me even she is annoyed at how inferior her camera performs against IQOO 7 Legend. Although that is limited to only photography. iPhone flat-out wrecks IQOO at videography though.<br>Performance: Almost flawless. Just damn fine. Keeps up with the BMW legacy.<br>OS: Funtouch OS always felt cheap, unfinished and bloated. Well it still somewhat retains the same properties. Just waiting for Origin OS, the true IQOO UI.<br>Display: This is the tricky part and IQOO certainly skipped steps here. The original product had horrendous green tint all over the display at low brightness.<br>Display(replacement): So far I think the replacement has better display with less impacting green noise. But it's definitely there.<br>Solution: Unfortunately many last gen AMOLED screens suffered through the same. Even Samsung, Apple or 1+. Luckily Devs can recalibrate their algorithms to filter out the issue mostly. Said Devs like Apple, 1+ and Samsung released some updates later which reduced the issue by a whole lot.

I have seen somany reviews but the onhand feeling is very different.even the BMW racing lines are designed very well. Power button color every thing looks good.<br>Display : 4.5<br>Body to screen display: 4<br>Call quality : 4<br>Speaker output : 3.5 Previously used ROG2 might be that is impacting me 😉<br>Back over quality :4<br>Back cover design :2.5 too much branding which is spoiling the look<br>Camera : 4 As this is coming with SD888 don't compare with Samsung S21 series it's double the price. At his price point we can capture good quality pics.<br>Customization: 4 there are so many customizations for every thing. But these should not impact the mobile in long run 🙏.<br>Charger : 5 this is the ultimate thing 👍. Super fast ⏩ charging.<br><br>After checking different mobiles having SD870 and 888<br>Finally I ended over Legend for the best deal. I have replaced my too old mobile and got 7k for exchange and 4k offer . I have paid nearly 32k. Even for 35K this is the best in the market. Don't go with branding. Even OnePlus started like this only. Let's hope for the best.<br>There are few unnecessary apps.<br><br>Will edit after using it for few more days.,4.0 out of 5 stars
3226,"Words from a Oneplus 5T user, ""A worthy upgrade in 2021""","&nbsp;So finally after reading reviews and watching mostly all videos about this phone I decided to go with this one. I got this phone for 42k during offer period.<br>Pros :<br>1. Phone is best in performance and refresh rate makes the display experience butter smooth.<br>2. Face unlock is snappy as soon as you get the phone in your hand it will unlock it so no delays in that.<br>3. Gaming is also smooth and I faced no lag issues or frame drops, all perfect.<br>4. Camera performance is just damn good bruh!!! It was unexpected for me to get this kind of quality.<br>5. Funtouch OS is almost a complete match to the Oxygen OS and after disabling and uninstalling the unwanted apps the User experience is great!!!<br>Cons:<br>1. Back cover provided with the phone is too slippery, so don't use it. The phone has got a good grip itself,so don't worry about it.<br>2. Fingerprint sensor is not that great, takes about twice impressions to recognize sometimes but face unlock compensates that so I don't have too much issue with that.<br>3. Green tint issue is there in my unit in lower half of the screen.<br>4. Facing heating issue while gaming and charging which is disappointing. But I have noticed that all 888 chip phones are facing this issue. So waiting for an update to get it corrected.<br>5. Battery life is average and gives almost a day backup.<br><br>All n all its a great phone in this range n with the best snapdragon chip inside. So don't think too much as no phone is perfect, you will get issue in every company's phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars
3227,"Great hardware, medicore software","The phone itself is pretty solid with a great display (despite the green tint issue which is practically present on all AMOLED high refresh rate screens). The camera, battery (despite being 4k), speakers are all pretty great too. The charging speed is phenomenal. The main problem with this is the poor software experience. It comes installed withsl some third party bloatware and a lot of system bloatware that cannot be uninstalled or disabled. The bootloader cannot be unlocked and as such you cannot use custom ROMs which is pretty sad considering Funtouch OS is as the title says medicore at best. Basic things such as notification panel have issues with quick reply (the text is always shown in capital's), the quick reply bar itself is cropped when typing a reply, there's no global heads-up toggle, the navigation gestures doesn't have a quick switch toggle. The dark mode is greyish instead of black but with black notifications so the entire panel looks inconsistent. The camera app could be smoother. Overall it's still a pretty solid device especially for the price despite all its software flaws which would hopefully be fixed by Vivo. Imo they should still let developers access and allow users to unlock BL and flash custom ROMs that itself would make this phone the best choice for everyone in the premium segment.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3229,Batter life is average on this phone,"I have 12gb Ram 256 gb rom model, I got this at ₹34,400 and getting a flagship device at this price is a great feeling. Let's divide review in pros and cons-<br>Pros-<br>1. Great AMOLED panel, brings out vivid colours.<br>2. Awesome network connectivity<br>3. Gaming beast- I played Battlegrounds Mobile India, Call of Duty, Asphalt 9, and other heavy graphic centric games and it performed exceptionally well. There was no fps drop while taking hot drop in pochinki, bootcamp.<br>4. Camera- It is also one of the best at this price range. You get bright images in daylight and even in artificial lighting, the doesn't disappoint. However, front camera is ok ok.<br>5. Overall a smooth experience when using this device casually.<br>Cons-<br>1. Average battery life, however 66w flash charge helps, it fully charges the phone within 35 minutes.<br>2. Lots of bloatware- I prefer you to not use apps like vivo vstore, hot apps, hot games, as they ask for lots of permission. Basically these bloatware is of no use.<br>Verdict- Overall a great package from IQOO, its definitely a flagship killer. If you are gamer, just go for it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Would be very Happy if BGMI provides dedicated controls for pressure sensitive Touch aka 3D touch .<br><br>2.Charging speeds are insane ,0 - 100 % 20:05 mins avg .<br><br>3.Sound has Bass that packs punch ,its powerful .<br><br>4.Camera and Night Nodes performs very well under indoor conditions and low light . no Regret there ,only thing that i am missing is customizing the watermark with special characters which is not on this device as of now .Taking Pics and recording HD content does not Heat Up the phone .<br><br>5.sunlight readability is good w.r.t the DISPLAY<br><br>6.Has Google Files for safe Data storing /making this private .<br><br>Overall I say its a good purchase and would recommend to anyone who like power packed features .",4.0 out of 5 stars
3232,Great purchase,Great product from Vivo. But it used to be a gaming phone so should have some extra controls,4.0 out of 5 stars

Haven't encountered any major bugs yet OS is smooth no jitters or lags. Speakers are also good. Battery is a bit less it may or may not last a day depending on your usage I get 4.30 hours of SOT.,4.0 out of 5 stars
3234,Few hiccups But Mostly a very Good phone for Price,"When I order this phone I was sceptical about it as I have heard bad things about software in iqoo 3.<br><br>I ordered this phone during pre booking and was willing to take risk with software.<br><br>The hardware of the phone is really amazing be it the triple camera set up( without any useless 2MP sensors), inscreen Finger print scanner, fast ram and rom, clicky and tactile buttons ..in short Hardware is amazing<br>But<br>Software is where it all start to go sideways<br>It runs on funtouch OS based on Android 11.<br>Funtouch OS is full of bloatware, unnecessary double apps like Notes, browser, playstore, games and other useless apps. It constantly give you useless notification. You can uninstall many apps but there are still many apps which are backed in OS and you cant even disable them. All you can do in turnoff notification for them and force stop them and never to open them.. Rest the OS is very close to stock Android it tons of customisation options<br>If IQOO can fix this and make software bloatware free I can recommend this phone to everyone without issue",4.0 out of 5 stars
3235,AMAZING PHONE FOR GAMING,BEST FOR GAMING AND CAMERA. ONLY DRAWEBACK IS THE SHORT BATTERY LIFE. NOTHING ELSE. BUT THE 66 WATTS POWER ADAPTER WORKS REALLY FAST. IT CAN FULLY CHARGE THE DEVICE FROM 0- 100% IN LESS THAN 21 MINUTES. HATS OFF TO THE IQOO TEAM. CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE,4.0 out of 5 stars
3236,Summary review!!,1) A big mobile. If ur fan of compact phones this will feel heavy and big. But this is a beautifully executed mobile.<br>2) Excellent Haptics.<br>3) Heating issue was not as much as expected.<br>4) Excellent Speakers.<br>5) The only drawback is the UI. It feels really underdeveloped. Color os and MIUI is lot better. They should bring about more Material You elements of Android 12,4.0 out of 5 stars
3237,Legendary performance,"First of all that pearl white smooth finish and BMW track design is very attractive. 120hz fhd display is another level very good colour accuracy and low latency touch works awesome.<br>No need to say about camera simply awesome 2x zoom and potrait lens are awesome good dynamic range fair colour accuracy good image processing is simply perfect. It's 888 no need to tell performance beast. 8+3gb ram it really holds so many apps in background, at a time 2 heavy games can handle. No throttling at all, it will get little warm if you play heavy games but for 888 processer it's best heat destination. Surprisingly at charging also it's get just only little warm 35-38deg (summer) u never feel it warm at all. It's has very cool gaming mods that I don't use much . Funtouch os is ok, if origin os it's will be perfect. Battery life is very good for 4k mah full one day for mid-heavy use i got around 7hrs screen on time . The flash charging is like barry allen 0-100% just in 27min. Overall very worth for 35k.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3245,This Time IQOO Rocks,"I got this phone with 5000 discount coupon n icici card and @38990. Phone is not bad. But IQOO as compared to China unit has not given Gorilla glass 6 on front n back instead it has given Scot xensation glass which is not a good protection overall. Also in china the charger is 120 watt as compared to 66 watts in Indian unit. As far as OS is concerned, IQOO in India has given Funtouch OS 11.1 as compared to Origin OS in China unit. Rest all is same. But thank God for not giving Monster UI as was given in IQOO 3 which was a real crap. Over all i would like to say that this phone can be taken. Amazon now has removed 2000 rupees coupon from Legend variant which will certainly affect IQOO 7 legend Sale as per my opinion. 4 star just that IQOO has not given Gorilla Glass 6 and 120 watts charger in Indian retail unit.

3343,Best ever steal deal.,"Ok I'll write a simple pros and cons review that can help people decide whether to buy this device or not.<br><br>I was using Redmi K20 before buying this mobile &amp; I got my 2 yrs older K20 exchanged. I got  this mobile in 14500/- INR after all the exchange value and bank discount. Now coming to the mobile usage experience.<br><br>What I liked in this device:<br>1. watching videos, it's a whole new experience for a K20 user.<br>2. Side mounted finger print reader ok.<br>3. I don't understand people complaining about slow charging, it has a 33 Watt fast charger and it does a decent job.<br>4. Dolby sound is a new experience for me and I liked it very much.<br>5. Snapdragon 870 is insanely fast &amp; you won't notice any glitches during multimedia handling.<br>6. Speakers and network connectivity is very good.<br>7. Haptic feedback is a new thing for me and I guess it's not that bad on 11X.<br><br>What I didn't like:<br>1. Proximity sensor is malfunctioning.<br>2. Drop down window is unstable.<br>3. Camera quality has been compromised in this device, I was not impressed with the 4k videos taken during low light, although I'll try during daytime and let you know.<br>4. Battery drains a bit faster if I switch to 120hz screen.<br>5. It has a plastic back unlike my older k20 which makes it look less premium..<br>6. No notification LED<br>7. Double tap to lock screen not working.<br>8. Call recorder is useless, who tells the person on call that this call is being recorded. Complete rubbish.<br>8. Battery does not go beyond 99%, it is not charging upto 100%.<br>9. Color formation on screen are not upto the mark, you have to turn on full brightness during daylight.<br><br>All in all it has some software related issues that will be resolved in coming days.<br>I am a multimedia user and I don't play games on mobile. So I don't think it's a bad device given the exchange offers and its price tag. It is a flagship experience and phone won't disappoint you. My K20 worked so well in 2 yrs that I developed my trust in Xiaomi. I miss pop up selfie camera and in display finger print reader but I guess I'll get used to new features.<br><br>Thank u 👍",3.0 out of 5 stars

3353,Dissatisfied and feel like fraud,Product was very good but buy back facility was as like fraud they offers me 10k on my poco f1 as I Axcpected the amount was good. Buy when Dilevry agent came to me he refused my phone exchange and gave me some stupid resions like my mobile has some Scarthes on back which is a obvious thing for  2 year old mobile. Than Dilevry agent refuse my buy back because he gave me same reason. And ask me to replace my mobile body. And then offers me if I give him 1000/- rs than he will do this buy back for me. My back offer amount was really good so I have any other option.<br>But seriously now Amazon not posting my review on their website.

3355,Camera software update is needed,"Snapdragon 870 within 28k range is a great deal on its own. But what is the use of high end processor? Gaming?

Because of it's weight; 4000+ mah battery is normal now a days; and many companies providing phns with the same specifications within 170 gm and it weighs almost 200gm which effects long gaming seasons in my opinion.<br><br>Camera sensor is great, but it needs better software optimization for image processing; 48 mp images takes too much time to load and don't even have great image quality. Normal pictures gives better results, also the ultra wide pics are great. But the macro sensor is waste of money,lack of hardware as well as software provides horrible macro shots, there is no deapth sensor, so potrait mode is software based, and the software optimization is horrible there also, but they can fix the potrait mode by optimising for natural potrait shots rather that beautified potrait shots. Camera software update is too much necessary that's why.",3.0 out of 5 stars

3383,Just the worst in every way imaginable!,"So having spent nearly 2 weeks with this phone, here's my take on it.<br>Pros:<br> incredible screen,<br>Blazing fast sd 870 processor (I have the 6gb variant, and it's not lagged on me once),<br>Great premium look.<br>Cons:<br>The worst, and I do mean the WORST camera I have come across since I can remember! My wife's 3+ year old iphone x camera is far better! Pictures are noisy and grainy even from close distance and in good lighting!!!<br>I don't know what's up with the proximity sensor, but the screen randomly blacks out, especially while trying to make calls( geekyranjit spoke about it on YT) and almost every time when listening to whatsApp/telegram audio messages! And it stays blacked out for like 5-10 seconds, and tapping the screen, clicking lock button doesn't do anything! It's very annoying and very weird, I hope a software update fixes this. There's a wierd glitch where if the battery is charged below 100/99%, it drains like crazy! Barely lasts half a day even on 90% an minimal use. Drains of upto 35% overnight(standby) observed! But if it's charged full, then it lasts over 1.5 days! Thankfully no overheating issues and speakers are great too. I actually sold my s21 ultra and bought this as that phone was just a camera and nothing else. It was riddled with overheating and battery drain issues, not to mention cheap adds everywhere! It would randomly restart too. Was a nightmare that I paid 1.06 lakhs for!!! Surprisingly, this phone is a breeze to use, the miui has no adds and minimal bloatware. Also the side fingerprint reader is incredibly fast and accurate, but it's right where you would hold the phone, so expect annoying accidental touches every time! Still better than s21u ""larger&amp; improved"" On screen sensor, which NEVER worked :/...So to conclude, I'm happy saving my money, but mine is a unique case. And I will not recommend anyone to buy this phone, unless they absolutely don't care about the camera and just want a great processor and screen, in which case, go for it.<br><br>1 month update: changing my review from 3 to 1 star! The battery just keeps getting worse and the battery usage doesn't know what the hell is going on. It just says mostly used by screen and phone idle, as if that's of any use :/.

Super Exceptional display:<br>• Unparalled display , unseen in the industry at this price band ??? ; my friends having One Plus are now regretting<br>• after having a look at the display one question that came to my find - is it really a 30K phone or am I missing anything?<br>• Colors on display are of the next level- very vivid and bright yet natural<br>• Latest E4 Amoled is magical – vivid colors, 1300 nits brightness, beyond comparison. Thanks Xiaomi for bringing a display found in competition phones upward of 1 lakh Rs<br>• Perfect for gaming. Highest touch sampling rate of 360 Hz doing its magic<br>• That punch hole is literally invisible. Haven’t seen a smaller punch-hole on any phone<br><br>2. Snapdragon 870 - one of the strongest and latest<br>• Have been using this phone for gaming and this just kills anything that’s brough it. Extremely good performance<br>• Absolutely  no heating at all despite gaming and hours of video watching<br>• Snapdragon processor plus DisplayMate A+ display plus 360 Hz touch sampling rate just makes this the best phone for gaming<br><br>3. Camera<br>• Beautiful camera setup – Xiaomi just never ceases to amaze with their camera<br>• This is a refreshing breather from usual saturated pictures. Xiaomi has just nailed the camera tuning on the device to get the perfect shots on the device<br>• Xiaomi in unparalalled when it comes camera features – in love with what all this device can do.<br>o Time freeze motion mode<br>o clone mode<br>o The level of detailing on AI Skyscaping pitch perfect<br>• Best camera phone I’ve used so far<br><br>4. Design<br>o The best implementation of glossy black in my opinion. It’s just beautiful and looks super premium<br>• Xiaomi never ceases to surprise with its colors<br>• Feel great in the hand<br>• Finally a flagship that’s thin and light. it is a perfect device feel<br><br>- Pleasantly surprised with how slim the device feels despite packing such a  big batter. Not sure what tech Xiaomi has used, but double thumbs up for this<br>• This phone just feel right to hold! Kudos to their design team<br><br>5. MiUI<br>• Finally Xiaomi has heard its consumers. MiUI on this device is an absolute  pleasure to use<br>• it would not be an exaggeration to say that it is the cleanest UI in the industry now<br>• Absolutely No Bloatwares and a very clean experience<br>• Wow! Xiaomi has finally combined best hardware with amazing software. Cleanest, and slick MiUI ever! Thanks Xiaomi<br>• I saw videos of how MiUI is more optimized and clean on Mi 11X. While I was apprehensive, but now I understand what they meant. This is a great effort on Xiaomi’s part.<br><br>6. Other features<br>• I thought Audio zoom was a gimmick, but that actually works. looks like a sci fi experience  Great job Xiaomi!<br>• Audio zoom with camera zoom is a master stroke.<br>• Xiaomi understands Indian fans better than anyone and this comes with IP 53 rating , protects your flagship with simple splashes etc.<br>• The beauty of this phone is guarded by Gorilla glass 5 on front and back  No compromise on quality",5.0 out of 5 stars

3425,Nothing beats this for the price,"I've had this phone for a month now and man it's been awesome.<br>Everything is great about this phone, I've seen many YouTubers complaining about the Cameras but it depends, like come on. If you give any person from a general population a DSLR, most won't even know how to use it and there are some who'll take DSLR like shots from phones itself, it basically come down to the skills more rather than the camera hardware, besides, you've got all these photo editing apps to make the image look according to your preference so I'd say cameras are good enough, you can install GCam too if you really want that post processing. Video features are amazing the battery easily gives me about 6-7 hours SoT on average to heavy usage. Gaming is great and I literally have no complaints about this phone except for one. If you like using the phone without the case, don't go with the black color option, it's literally a mirror and gets too much smudges. I'd recommend you the white one, it's clean and sexy af, anyway. The phone's great, even in 2022, I think this has to be the best for the money.

It does get hot during summers but that's common to all phones with high end processors.<br><br>Updating this review because got the much awaited MIUI 12.5. A few thoughts on it.<br><br>1. It feels a lot faster. Gestures especially seem to be very optimized on 12.5 and haptics are much better.<br>2. Battery life seems have to improved by 40-50 mins<br>3. Allows for removing almost all the apps. Making it cleaner experience if one wants it.<br>4. Visuually the icons look much cleaner to the eye.<br>5.

I applied a coupon discount (I don't remember from where did I get that coupon) of INR 1999 + HDFC Credit Card Offer of INR 3500. This was a Steal Deal for me.<br><br>Now let's come to the 'actual' review.<br><br>Design - 9.5/10 - The Cosmic Black colour is classy and sassy. Deducted 0.5 mark because the back side is a fingerprint magnet and there's a slight camera bump although both the issues can be solved easily by putting on a good back cover.<br><br>Screen - 9/10 - 120 Hz Refresh Rate + 360 Hz Touch sampling rate + HDR 10+ Display with 1300 Nits of peak brightness is an absolute blessing. Deducted 1 mark because the screen resolution is full HD Plus and not Quad HD.<br><br>Performance - 10/10 - Snapdragon 870 with Adreno 650 in a sub 30k phone. This deserves a 10/10.<br><br>Durability - 8.5/10 - Gorilla Glass 5 on front and back is definitely a plus. What breaks my heart is that it's IP 53 certified and not an IP 68 certified Device although IP 53 is justified for its price tag but I'm a bit greedy 😛<br><br>Battery - 9/10 - 4520 mAh with 33 Watt fast charging. In actual test it charged from 1% to 100% in 56 minutes which is at par with the claim. Deducted 1 mark because it gets slightly heated during charging and gaming. I understand that it happens with all the device but it's little more compared to my OnePlus 8 Pro. Honourable mention to the ultra battery saver mode, I don't what crazy stuff is that but in emergency that shit will last you a whole day with just 15% battery.<br><br>Camera - 8/10 - At par with most of the competition in its range. I particularly liked it's Dual mode where you can use both front and back camera at once and also it's colour accuracy is good but you may sometimes find blown out highlights when the background is shiny even with HDR on. Also video Stabilization is very average.<br><br>Sound - 9/10 - Clear sound and loud enough.<br><br>Final verdict - It's one the best bet in it's price segment and if you can have it below 28K then go for it blindly.

3435,Best choice for 5G phone under 25k,"I got it for 19k with replacement. Thought the phone was released in April 2021, its can still compete with many newly launched ones. Snapdragon 870 5G is one of the best in the range and performs so. 120Hz Super Amoled display is gorgeous and super smooth. It has stereo speakers with nice and loud sound.

Often times I couldn't get it to do what I wanted it to do. And there are too many gimmicky things that you lose count of what does what. It was my first experience with MIUI so maybe that's why.<br><br>The biggest con has to be the resale value. It had an MRP value of 34999 iirc, and I got it for 22000 after exchange. I tried to resell it after a couple of days and the best offer I could get for it was 19000. And even Amazon was selling it for 22000 without exchange.

The phone looked stunning right from unboxing, the design looked fresh and gave a flagship experience. Finally, I have a phone that feels comfortable in my hand and doesn't feel like I'm holding a heavy brick. Must say the real MVP is the display on the phone, this has to be the best display that you can find in this price segment, I have tried a lot of so-called flagships and their screens looked so dull as compared to the Mi 11x. I watch a lot of TV shows and anime on my phone and this has completely changed my experience, hats off to Xiaomi for pulling this one. First impression of using MIUI has been amazing till now, it's crisp, filled with so many functionalities and customizable in almost every aspect.<br>Next would be the camera, I had seen a lot of youtube reviews before buying it and have to say that the device is bang-on, just loving the macro photos. One unique feature is the audio zoom, that combined with video zoom takes videos to the next level.",5.0 out of 5 stars

With so many cool shooting modes like clone mode and the time freeze mode with AI skyscaping, I can now proudly flaunt my photography skills with ease.<br><br>The phone fits perfectly in your hand and is super light and slim even after having so many flagship hardware and specs. The frosted glass back make the phone look extremely gorgeous.<br><br>The MIUI on this phone is the claenest I have seen. No bloatware on the UI accentuates the experience even more.<br><br>Camera zoom coupled with audio Zoom seemed to be a little too much to ask for but when I really tried this on my phone, I was pleasantly surprised and this cool feature could prove to be of fantastic use in adverse shooting conditions.<br><br>Overall a 10 on 10 to the phone and Xiaomi has really proved that when it comes to technology, they are the best in the industry.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Even this issue green tint issue is common nowadays in 120hz displays...even OnePlus 8 pro,nord, samsung s20 etc had this issue .So Xiaomi should look at their quality control..<br><br>I was using Honor 8 pro but last year it stopped working and dead then I started using old redmi note 3 which was there at my home and bought it in 2016.When i was using Honor 8 pro,i used to hate miui becoz of bugs, interface,ui and icons etc but when i used redmi note 3,i became used to miui then after that i was looking at phone with flagship processor, performance,display speakers etc from dec 2020..saw OnePlus nord in store but didn't liked it..So in april Mi11x launched..i was thinking and expecting it to launch at 25k for base variant 6gb ram but it launched at 30k..it was out of budget so i waitee for 2 months for offers and finally bought it at 26k..and i would say its a best device under 27k in terms of display speakers, performance, design etc so lets talk about seperate points in detail<br><br>1. PERFORMANCE: Its the best phone under 30k in terms of performance,I switched from Huawei kirin 960(Honor 8 pro) to Snapdragon 650(redmi note 3) to Snapdragon 870(Mi11x)<br>So it was a huge upgrade for me..Phone is super responsive and quick..It has latest ufs 3.1,lpddr5 ram which makes this phone as a performance flagship..Games run at 60 fps with no lags,fame drops..Even Snapdragon 870 was one of the reason to buy this phone.As we know Snapdragon processors are more optimised,has no heating issues,more support to custom roms,more optimised for games,long lasting compared to mediatek processors<br><br>DISPLAY: Its the best under 30k,Superamoled 120hz..even better than samsung A51's display,also it is rated A+ by display mate..Its very bright at outdoors 1300 nits..So no doubt about display<br><br>Design And In hand Feel: Its very good and feels very premium in hands due to glass back but it should have had come with matt black color..becoz cosmic black color is very fingerprint magnet..but if u use back cover then no problem..also instead of plastic frame,then should have had given metal frame<br>But under 30k most of oems are giving plastic frame..<br><br>CAMERA: Its decent,I compared Mi11x's camera with Samsung A51 and found no difference,even in details.. Even Samsung's sensor captures more light and photos looks brighter and post processing of samsung literally change the photo..So Mi11x has decent/avg camera..they should have had given Sony imx 586 instead of 582..So in updates Xiaomi definitely needs to improve camera, post processing by software updates..Macro camera is very good.. selfie camera is also good<br>In video recording, Xiaomi has given eis even at 4k 30 fps.. videos are very stable from this device<br>Iqoo 7 has better camera than Mi11x<br><br>HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Xiaomi used X axis linear motor for haptic feedback and Its top notch,flagship level..We can feel different types of vibration in different tasks..not like normal vibration motor Also I had haptic feedback issue on my new Mi11x after replacing... previous one didn't have that issue Haptic didn't worked with back gestures etc so after uninstalling system launcher updates it started working again..many of users also faced this issue..<br><br>SOFTWARE: Since i was hater of miui,but after using miui 12.5,my thoughts literally changed..Miui 12.5 is very optimised,no ads,no such bloatware,feels smooth and has tons of features which u never think about BUT Xiaomi india do partiality in terms of updates, features..In Chinese Miui 12.5 u can install many of system apps which cant be uninstalled in Indian/Global Miui 12.5 and Chinese miui has more features compared to Indian/Global Miui<br>So Xiaomi definitely needs to treat Indian miui users same as Chinese ones and should provide give same features to both So Software is the only thing where Xiaomi is lacking right now so they should improve miui like samsung one ui or OnePlus oxygen os<br><br>BATTERY LIFE : Its good and lasts full day..If u r a normal user then u will get 7-8 hrs of Sot easily in 120hz and if u r a heavy user who play games then u will get 5 and half hrs to 6 hrs of sot in 120hz..In 60hz u will get even more sot<br>FINGERPRINT SCANNER: Before buying this phone i used to hate side mounted fingerprint scanners but after using this device,i can say side mounted are way more accurate,faster than in display ones..But if Xiaomi is selling this phone at 30k then they should have added in display fingerprint scanner<br><br>CHARGING: Xiaomi provided 33 watt charger in box which is sufficient and phone takes around 45-55 min to full charge which is enough..but competition is providing 65,66 watt charging but it degrades battery health..33 watt charger is sweet spot<br><br>Speakers: Xiaomi ahs given proper speaker instead of giving it in earpiece.. Speakers are very loud and crisp..we can say its a proper dual stereo speakers with hi res certified and also has dolby atoms<br>5G: Mi11x has only 2 5G bands..even global version of Mi11x which is poco f3 has multiple 5G bands but in india they only gave 2..Even OnePlus nord,9,9 pro,9r has 1 or 2 5G bands,Iqoo 7 u also has 1 so dont know why companies are not giving multiple 5G bands in india only..Also not sure whether 5G bands can be unlocked by software updates or not in future<br>This phone also has memc technology which can convert 30fps video to 60 fps<br>Also if u use custom roms in your phone,then this phone is for you..becoz Xiaomi phones has best custom roms support which is not the case with iqoo,realme etc..Even after Xiaomi stops giving updates then u can install various custom roms<br>So If your priority is performance,display,speakers, premium feel etc then u should look at this phone and if u r a a person who consume more content or who take photos casually can also buy this phone..<br>So decision is yours<br>So I can sum up with<br>Camera: 6/10<br>Performance: 10/10<br>Display: 10/10<br>Battery: 8/10<br>Software: 7/10<br>Speakers: 9/10<br>Overall: 8/10",4.0 out of 5 stars

3525,Phone for the enthusiastic,"Okay so first thing first, if you want a phone that can game well, can capture good snaps and an overall package go for iqoo legends other then that if you want to flash custom rom in sd 870 then you can think about this as iqoo have locked bootloader , now that's aside let's move on to review<br>also known as k40/poco f3 mi11x can easily become your daily driver, if you can get this phone in 20-25k bracket during offers, if it costs more then that go for some other phone, this phone have great combination of specs and looks, silver edition.<br><br>Pros : Great Display, but some of the phones have black crush issue, mine don't have any such and display can be set to 60hz/120hz by default it is set to 60hz possibly to conserve battery.<br><br>Processor : SD 870 is better then SD 888 imo as it doesn't heats up like kiln like 888 does, SD 870 is power hungry chip so it does makes the phone warm while you are playing heavy games like Genshin Impact, still the performance does not drop, Dimensity is also great but SD 870 have good ROM support from the devs, and cherry on top you can unlock the bootloader after the phone warranty ends and you can kick out miui and get the pixel experience asap,<br><br>Battery: Good battery life for a day, 120hz is battery drainer so remember to keep the display to 60hz with battery saver if you want the phone to last 2 days still with 120hz you can last whole day<br><br>Charging : 33w charger makes sure you can reach full charge in a hour, and does not kills battery like the 120w charger does<br><br>Sound: The dolby is implemented well and it does sounds clear.<br><br>Build Quality : it does feels premium, go for the silver edition as black edition is glossy amd finger print magnet<br><br>Now for the cons<br><br>Proximity Sensor : Xiomi uses Virtual proximity Sensor which is another way of saying it doesn't of proximity sensor and it uses accelometre to mimic proximity sensor and that causes problems , it is not deal breaking but still cannot deny physical proximity sensor would have been better<br><br>Cameras: Don't even want to talk about this, Poco f1 had better cameras then this. it is good camera but yeah if you want phone with good cameras go for some other phone.<br><br>These are the things which you should knoe beforehand making a decision to go with this phone or not",4.0 out of 5 stars
3526,Great performance &amp; value for money!,"I am writing this review after using this phone for 10 days. Quick summary below is followed by detailed feature wise experience that I had while using this phone.<br><br>Pros: Great performance, Amazing screen, Good stereo speakers, good haptic feedback, slim phone and good in hand feel/ balance<br>Cons: Average rear camera, bloatware/ preinstalled apps in MIUI, no 256 Gb option, fingerprint magnet (cosmic black version), no 3.5 mm jack (it still matters for some :) )<br><br>I am adding a detailed review below for those who are interested in details -<br><br>Build - The phone is sleek and quite slim compared to other phones. Overall in hand feel is definitely premium. The rounded camera setup also looks nice. The back however is a fingerprint magnet and too glossy (cosmic black variant). It took me a while to get used to side mounted fingerprint sensor, but once used to - it is quite snappy and well placed<br><br>Screen - The screen is amazing and the 120hz option definitely helps the overall experience. Brightness  in sunny condition is more than enough, especially if on Auto. Bezels are super slim and the front camera punch hole is so small, you hardly notice it. Haptic feedback is also very nice<br><br>Camera - The camera is definitely not the best feature of this phone but it is not as bad as some people claim. Its a decent performer and does well in well lit surroundings. Indoor and low light photos are not that great though. Macro shots came out surprisingly well. Selfie cam is quite wide and great for group selfies. Overall a decent performer. But if camera is the main feature for you, then you should probably look for other options.<br><br>Sound - The stereo speakers are surprisingly good! the sound is quite clear, loud enough and well balanced. While using headphones, I did find the sound to be a bit flat and focused on high frequencies (Treble). The settings allow you to tweak equalizer settings though so after that adjustment, mids (vocal) and lows (bass) come out decent. Usb type c to 3.5 mm jack dongle is provided within the box (good news for those who prefer wired headphones like me!)<br><br>Performance - The day to day usage is very snappy and gives you a buttery smooth experience. Apps open up quite fast and memory management is balanced as well. I have 6Gb variant and didn't feel any need of more RAM<br><br>Gaming - I tried out call of duty and Freefire on this phone along with some other less intensive games. all of them ran smoothly at high settings. The phone does get bit warm during extended gaming sessions but stays at an acceptable temperature. For moderate to high intensity gamers - this phones seems perfect<br><br>Battery - The battery lasted 30+ hrs  (100% to 10%) per charge consistently for me and that was a pleasant surprise as this phone has only 4.5k MAh battery and 120Hz refresh rate can consume battery fast. For moderate users, it should easily last more than a day.<br><br>Overall, at this price range (27.5k if you include the offer) I think this phone is a great allrounder and value for money.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I got a good deal, For that I want to thank darshita mobile, and amazon. Thank you.<br>One thing about the phone which is not clear, why it is showing 114gb for usage. when it says 128 Gb. I mean it's a 14 gb loss. I'm not a technophile. but I can say that pre installed stuff or whatever, do not need to occupy 14gb. That's what's eating me. And moreover when i connect the phone to laptop it shows 96.7 gb available of 106gb, I was really shocked to see that i bought phone with 128gb storage and what i get is 96 gb.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3537,Device is great just not for photography otherwise perfect device to have.,"I have been a Xiaomi user from the very beginning and it is my favourite brand even now.<br>As we know everything has its ups and downs everyone faces downs so do mi with its miui software the last phone that I used was a poco device (my first and my last poco branding device) . While I was buying this device frankly speaking I was afraid about facing same problems in software in miui but in this device till now no issues related with software faced, so thumbs up for the issues related with software , and mi reallly needs to upgrade it's camera software for better image processing for now I am using gcam which is easily available and accessible so no issue in that part because gcam got it covered. No lag in gaming faced till now. One thing I am confused with is about network issue though I am not confirm if it is some bug or my network provider issue . Very happy with the device no issues faced till now to be reported waiting for miui 13 coz heard they have  removed what bugs are left in miui.☺️",4.0 out of 5 stars
3538,Could have been more better as per price,"I have got this device on 14th April, 2022, the device looks very pretty and weight distribution is perfect, camera setup is also good, but 48 MP primery camera in the segment of 30 k is not enough, atleast 64mp they can provide. Battery 4520mAh can also be extend to 5000mAh then it would have more perfect combination. BTW the battery backup on latest miui 13 is very good. The flagship 870 SDM is masterpiece in the device. The amoled display is good but not as bright as samsung devices.<br><br>Pros:<br>1) Snapdragon 870 flagship.<br>2) dual stereo speakers with dolby atmos<br>3) latest Android 12<br>4) build quality<br>5) front camera good.<br><br>Cons:<br>1) side mounted fingerprint in an amoled display<br>2) battery charging speed is not enough 33W, could have to 67W<br>3) 48 mp camera, no ois.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>Its a very good phone perheps so may cons as expected in the price segment.

Speaker quality is good ..above average than most of the phones in market. It supports Dolby but due to stock type C to 3.5 you can't hear soo great sounds even on iems (- BLON BL-03). if u are a average listener it good.<br>5. Charging - neither a  pro or not a con...it takes 1 hr.<br><br>Cons-<br>1.MIUI- it's a good and worst ui acc to me. Wen you move from pixel or OnePlus, you will really have a bad experience. And nowadays rooting is not a good thing as we use UPI apps .so really worst ui in bugs but good in customisation.<br>2.CAMERA- it's a good camera, but could have been better to provide a nice optimization. The macro is good but still need to be optimised.<br>Front camera is good for this price range.<br>3.PROXIMITY SENSOR- really worst sensor while talking in phone it won't work and there is no pocket mode which will prevent accidental wake in pocket...A HUGE PROBLEM ACC TO ME.<br>4.RAM USAGE- it always runs with high ram usage with 2 gb free of 6gb. A software optimization is really needed.<br>5. Some minor problems like full gesture support won't work on 3rd party software like Nova and other launchers.<br>6. I got random reboot 5-6 times in a month ..may be my unit problem.<br><br>For this price it's really worth for battery backup and Snapdragon 870.but if u want a good phone with good experience and don't want to root or anything GO FOR ONEPLUS 9R OR PIXEL .",4.0 out of 5 stars

But it way not my priority anyway. What bugs me is that screen during a videocall on some apps goes off and on randomly. Probably due to lack of proximeter.

It is a flagship device which gives a premium MIUI experience than previous devices with less bloatware and almost no ads .<br>It has a fantastic display and colours and sound . As for the Camera department there is a bit of a let down as they could have used better Camera sensors and better software optimization . I am not a serious photographer so the camera overall gives a decent quality to me and to mention so many Cinematic experience filters and effects present.<br>The performance is simply best no issue in any Game you play in it .<br>It does have a little heating issue , but not so major as it gets cool within minutes .<br>Overall as a user I can assure you that you won't regret as this price as it is giving you more on this price segment .",4.0 out of 5 stars
