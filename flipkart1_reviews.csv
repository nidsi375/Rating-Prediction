51,Waste of money!,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop.

The only con is that build quality is not that good but you can manage. The biggest myth is sound quality which quite loud in this but the 720p camera is very very bad , like bad as my previous laptop which was just 18000 in price .
In a nuty go for it don't think too much beleive me you will proud of your decision.

715,Wonderful,"It's good enough for almost anyone, So if you aren't bothered by a slightly bulki looking laptop then it's the best computer for this price range, try getting it with gst bill as you can get this for almost 46k...

716,Great Product (except webcam),"After two days of usage, laptop is working great. It is snappy and apps open very fast with zero lag.
I got battery backup of 5 hours with browsing and watching content.

Also note that lifetime MS Office is not provided.

You would have seen most of the reviews that the laptop has low volume speaker as a con!

Hello buyers who worry about low volume speakers. Just install latest audio driver from acer website and FX Sound app. You'll get huge difference! It's even louder!",5
793,Good quality product,"I'll give a detailed review below.
Pros-
Good battery backup because of U series,
Can handle top games which none does in the price segment,
-Build quality is good,
-Can be used for long term
-Cooling system is good
-Premium look,
-180¬∞ hinges

Cons-
-Speakers are not loud compared to others,
-Too heavy and bulky,
-No levels in backlit,
-Screen bleeding (common, cannot be termed as an issue)
-Charger comes from an other Chinese company (135watt),

Definitely a good option. Just go for it.",4

799,Terrific purchase,"My Opinion
Amazing product. Totally worth the price paid for. I've been using the laptop for a month now. Haven't observed any issues so far. Comes with a power efficient processor which does heavy duty tasks effortlessly. However, prolonged gaming is not recommended as it heats up after 4-5 hrs of usage. Regular day to day tasks work like charm. A must buy for Students, Office users and occasional gamers",5
800,Classy product,"Very neat and simple design for a gaming laptop, No heating issue.. Can be used for even official purpose, no MS office.. Value for money product..

804,Terrific purchase,"To be very honest this is amazing product.
The only con is that build quality is not that good but you can manage. The biggest myth is sound quality which quite loud in this but the 720p camera is very very bad , like bad as my previous laptop which was just 18000 in price .
In a nuty go for it don't think too much beleive me you will proud of your decision.
One thing to be noted this is my review after 2 hrs of its delivery.",5
805,Wonderful,"It's good enough for almost anyone, So if you aren't bothered by a slightly bulki looking laptop then it's the best computer for this price range, try getting it with gst bill as you can get this for almost 46k... It's good for any workload but there is a bunch of pre installed apps so delete them when you buy (was not expecting that)",4
806,Great Product (except webcam),"After two days of usage, laptop is working great. It is snappy and apps open very fast with zero lag.
I got battery backup of 5 hours with browsing and watching content.

Cons: 0.9 MP webcam is below average. Speaker volume is a bit low. I use headphones so I don't mind.
Also note that lifetime MS Office is not provided.

I got it for 54990. Buy it asap before they increase the price even more",5

Display is awesome but screen reflicting due to glossy display.

My recommendation is go for non OLED as in future there might be a chance of screen burning in OLED screens.",4

Speakers are located at the base of laptop. You may feel that sound is not loud enough if using on bed or lap.

Sometimes the fan can be a bit noisy. But given the laptop's capabilities, it's expected. Doesn't bother me much, just nitpick...

1867,Perfect product!,"Actually looking for a budget gaming laptop then I got this for a budget price and the performance was awesome and display quality is very great but the only con is the low audio output needs to install special drivers or external speakers for high audibility.
Battery backup is also very good with the ryzen 5 5600h hexa core processor with 144hz refresh rate absolutely good",5

1875,Nice product,"After Using 15 Days :
Pros : Performance is good , fast refresh rate , Good Looking , HP branding .
Cons : I cannot customise fans speed and fans automatically high and low even in low intensive work . But it's battery performance is not so good üò© . I have facing over heat issue.
But Overall it's great Laptop for high intensive work . 4/5",4
1876,Fair,"If you are looking for solely gaming then go for i5 11 gen it's better then ryzen 5600h in terms if gaming ..i have noticed sudden frame drops while playing gta v and others high end games(frame drops are rare but yeah you will see some jitters while gaming)
Over all the product is okayish performance is avg. Battery is kinda low ( although battery doesn't really matters much )
The only things really good would be it's thermals
I would suggest u to explore other options as there are better...

4235,Monster under 80K!,"Got this for 73k during BBD with FK Axis Card. This is an absolute monster for the price.
Bought this mainly for gaming and it runs everything on max settings without a sweat.
Boot time is crazy fast. Also, if you keep your laptop on sleep mode as I do, then it takes 2secs max to come back up completely.",5
4236,Perfect product!,"You just need to update and optimise it!!
And this Device will offer you everything it has!!
The SSD storage makes it so fast to transfer files and stuff, the WiFi 6 module helps in downloading from the internet at a very fast rate, the 144Hz screen is so colour accurate.
The inbuilt speaker volume is just a little above average.
Will update the review after some more usage!!",5

The biggest drawback of ASUS is that they have eliminated the RJ45 LAN connection port channel from the Laptop hardware device and they haven't provided additional and supported Asus LAN converter along with driver details which will kept the sale for this on back foot. I'M struggling badly due to this, either I need support from ASUS team else I have to ...

4786,Excellent,"Amazing Product at this price range.

I have been using it for almost 4 months now. Trust me, it is way better than what you can get at this price.

You can think of this as a mobile, with a keyboard. But I think that was the concept of chromebooks at the first place. I had bought it mainly for my office work and for browsing and doing my trading.

Pros.
1. Very lt wt and easy to carry.

3. Type C charger, USB port, hi speed wifi ...

4787,Mind-blowing purchase,"Pros:

1. Excellent battery backup.

With zoom/ movies etc @4-5 hrs daily, lasts more than a day.
If you are ONLY browsing 4-5 hrs daily, lasts more than 3 days.
Note: I used zoom meeting video call for 2 hrs - battery dropped by 25%
(All above results are at 50% brightness and most of the time with headphones)

2. The hinge seems pretty sturdy.

3. Laptop has rubber cushion lining along its entire perimeter - as a safety measure for accidental drops and tent mode.

4. Touchpad is pretty good...

1. Chromebooks are awesome from an OS standpoint, give you something different compared to windows but if they do come in your phone at minimal costs then why are such overpriced? Also with Celeron processors looks like a loot.

2. Three stars only as the product is usable and is best for daily minimal use (as OS is optimized to support weak processors).

4. Touch is average, camera performance is average and the main disappointment is the speaker, they are very poor for the 20k r...

5515,Classy product,Don't give it a second thought. Just buy it. Insanely fast and running faster than my old i7 laptop. Superb Design and top notch build quality. My user experience is awesome.,5
5516,Worth every penny,Writing the review after usage of 3 weeks. I'm in awe of this small beast. Performance is too good to be true plus the video and sound quality is just amazing. Worth the money in all terms. Battery backup is also great. Expect 12-13 hours on a single charge with normal usage which is way too higher as compared to any other window laptop. All in all couldn't have asked for.more. The only cons could be that it's not touch screen.,5
5517,Pretty good,"It is my first apple product ,what an awesome experience. I am so happy to get this MacBook AIR m1 .The performance, color contrast I can give 5 star ,especially the portable classy look of this MacBook air silver is so elegant, music clarity and my favorite part is the trackpad gesture .Overall rating I am giving 4 star because of the webcam. I am bit disappointed with the web cam. Didn't expect this bad quality of web cam.",4
5518,Just wow!,"Apple Mac has a class in it's own, simply outstanding!! The Big Billion Days offer makes it an even crazy deal. Great improvement from the last gen Mac, it now gets a crisper screen with less bezels and looks a lot more premium. You must use it to experience it.

Everything else is just perfect, excited to start using it more, Go for it without a second thought!!",5
5519,Highly recommended,Using it for a week now. Performance wise and battery backup are top notch. But weight but nice to hold and compact.,5
5520,Highly recommended,"It feels like magic!

Go for it.",5
5528,Terrific purchase,"If you're not a gamer, then this is the laptop you should own! Can handle everything else seamlessly. Top notch in all aspects.
It only has 2 usb-c ports, so might require a good quality dongle if there's a need, but other than that it's great",5
